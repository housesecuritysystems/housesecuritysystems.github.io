However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Many security systems are wireless and easy to install, but companies that offer DIY installation also offer installation guidance through customer support and online guides, so you're never alone.</p>
