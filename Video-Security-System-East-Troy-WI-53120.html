Standard CCTV camera lenses can only cover distances of between 35 and 40ft, therefore with C-mount CCTV cameras, it is possible to use special lenses, which can cover distances greater than 40ft. Outdoor motion sensors are most frequently used together with security cameras to make sure your garden remains safe from intruders.</p>
<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at. A camera that captures video at 720p will usually offer a fairly sharp picture, but 1080p video offers more detail and is the most popular resolution for these devices; it doesn't require lots of storage capacity and can be viewed on nearly all phones, tablets, and PCs.</p>

The price of the best home security systems varies widely, from a minimum of $30 to $50 per month for a basic system with a couple of door sensors and a motion sensor.

<p>Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. As a general rule, all cameras utilized in a security system for after-the-fact investigation and overall deterrence should be recorded and the recording retained in a 10-day library as a minimum.
