<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
<p>Burglar alarm circuits are triggered in a variety of ways. CCTV was initially developed as a means to increase security for banks but over time it has developed into a cost effective means of general video surveillance and home security. A single E-Series can scale to over 1.4PB, and when integrated as part of a video management solution, can provide multipetabyte scale.</p>

<p>The system is based on coaxial or electro-magnetic sensor cable with the controller having the ability to differentiate between signals from the cable or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing the fence, or bad weather conditions. This also depends on the provider, but you can anticipate signing a contract with providers who require professional installation of their systems.</p>
