<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Huawei HoloSens Intelligent Video & Data Analytics — built on Huawei's cutting-edge AI technologies and accumulated expertise in big data, the cloud, and 5G — revolutionizes the video surveillance industry, transforming it from a model of simple video collection, to one of 360° data awareness, moving from basic perception toward smart foresight and intelligent prediction.</p>
<p>However, combined with the compatible locks, alarms, webcams and sensors, you can create a seriously secure home. It also offers different monitoring plans based on the desired connectivity - landline, broadband or cellular.
