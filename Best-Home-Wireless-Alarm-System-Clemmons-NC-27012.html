Huawei HoloSens Intelligent Video & Data Analytics — built on Huawei's cutting-edge AI technologies and accumulated expertise in big data, the cloud, and 5G — revolutionizes the video surveillance industry, transforming it from a model of simple video collection, to one of 360° data awareness, moving from basic perception toward smart foresight and intelligent prediction.</p>
<p>Equipment's not the only thing that Ring Alarm sells on the cheap; it's also professional monitoring. Security cameras can be very helpful in alerting you to an event or showing you what happened after the fact.

At larger airports, this means the purchase, installation, and integration of hundreds or thousands of CCTV cameras.</p>

<p>That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>All of the technology based security hardware work hand in hand with the control panels in a house to relay all messages to the monitoring company. The price of professional monitoring will vary based on the equipment you choose. CCTV cameras can be placed in a location of your own choosing, and do not require extensive modifications to your existing infrastructure.</p>

CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security.
