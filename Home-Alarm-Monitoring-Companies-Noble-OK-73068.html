<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Nest Secure seamlessly integrates into Nest smart home ecosystems. CCTV cameras are available in various types depending on different characteristics. However, additional sensors and things such as cameras will increase the price, often significantly. Network cameras can be wireless and still work through a network and are used in big departmental stores, food chains, malls, factory, work shop, and many other public places to keep a check of the activities.</p>
<p>Using two clamp-on sensors and a 240V breaker, the Sense monitor samples current and voltage one million times per second to determine where your energy is going.
