<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

<p>Home automation features: Smart home automation features include HD video surveillance services, smoke and fire monitoring, smart door lock control, garage door control and smart lighting. In this direction, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (i.e. drones) are nowadays deployed in order to provide video surveillance versatility and functionalities that are hardly possible based on conventional fixed cameras.</p>
<p>Increasing investment from the government in smart city and public security projects in the Asia Pacific region also drives the growth of the video surveillance market. Through a home security app, you can monitor your system and control wireless devices with smart home automation technology, such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and IFTTT.
