We expect this trend to continue in the future and for the cybersecurity maturity gap between this industry and other high-tech industries to continue to shrink as more external pressure is applied on the people managing physical security systems. Another feature of intruder alarm systems include motion sensors. Around 170 million surveillance cameras are estimated to be present in China.</p>

Alarm Relay is a TMA Five Diamond monitoring center.

<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well.

The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
