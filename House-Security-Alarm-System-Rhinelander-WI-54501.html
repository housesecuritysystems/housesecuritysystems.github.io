<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? The indoor video camera comes with full 1080p HD video recording as well as two-way audio. It's the ideal choice for a security guard to monitor live video feed on site. A fully programmable environmental monitoring system, the Sensaphone 800 allows both local and remote monitoring and control of your home or small business. These are the premium packages you see that cost upwards of $350-$700 for the equipment and around $40-$60 per month for monitoring.</p>
