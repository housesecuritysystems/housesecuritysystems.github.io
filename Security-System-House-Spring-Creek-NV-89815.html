CCTV surveillance cameras can record colour during the day but at night, unless sufficient support lighting has been set up, they switch to black and white.</p>
<p>The main purpose of coming up with this project is to build an automatic greenhouse monitoring in which GSM module sends the information about temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture and status of appliances (fans, sprays, artificial lights and water pump) that are connected with circuit for controlling greenhouse effects or greenhouse parameters (temperature, humidity, light intensity and water supply for plants).</p>
<p>The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify.
