<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Cable 24 serves as a shunt resistor in the sense that whenever current is drawn from or charged to the battery, a voltage is created across cable 24. It is this voltage drop which provides the basic input signal to the circuitry illustrated in FIG. Be it IP cameras, megapixel cameras, HD-CCTV, video management systems (VMS), DVRs, compression, systems integration, monitors, fiber, analytics, WiFi or mesh networks, you'll find it here.</p>

<p>Megapixel cameras are so named because the images produced by these devices consist of millions of pixels. In broad terms, advanced video-based surveillance could be described as an intelligent video processing technique designed to assist security personnel's by providing reliable real-time alerts and to support efficient video analysis for forensic investigations.</p>
<p>Both of these costs tend to increase with security systems that feature security cameras, smart home devices, and home environmental monitoring devices.
