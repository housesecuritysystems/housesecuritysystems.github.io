<p>Today, the U.K. has over 6 million such devices, while the U.S. has tens of millions According to marketing firm IHS Markit, 1 billion cameras will be watching the world by the end of 2021, with the United States rivaling China's per person camera penetration rate Police can now track people across multiple cameras from a command-and-control center, desktop, or smartphone.</p>
