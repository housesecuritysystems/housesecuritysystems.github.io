If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>
