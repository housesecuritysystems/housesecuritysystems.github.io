<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Nest Secure seamlessly integrates into Nest smart home ecosystems. CCTV cameras are available in various types depending on different characteristics. However, additional sensors and things such as cameras will increase the price, often significantly. Network cameras can be wireless and still work through a network and are used in big departmental stores, food chains, malls, factory, work shop, and many other public places to keep a check of the activities.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. There are plenty of affordable cameras available that offer good video performance, but as with just about any smart device, you'll pay more for features such as motion tracking, facial recognition, cellular connectivity, time-lapse recording, both onboard and cloud storage options, and rechargeable battery power.</p>

If your FTP server is within the same network with the cameras, that would be better.</p>
