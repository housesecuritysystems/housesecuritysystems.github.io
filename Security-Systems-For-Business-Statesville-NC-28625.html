<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Most cameras also feature infrared night vision capable of surveillance in total darkness. The Monitoring Association (TMA) ensures quality and customer service excellence. It comes with a fast Wi-Fi set up functionality that enables you to install and monitor the camera through a specific mobile app on your smartphone or tablet. These wireless video security cameras feature adjustable motion detection and allow you to monitor your home's security through cellular connections or on the web.</p>

<p>Anti Theft Alarm System has function of wireless installation, flash and sound light alarm at same time and easy to use. However, high investments such as initial installment investment and large data storage problems, with lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras incur extra cost for the devices.

While there is no camera that can perfectly mimic the dynamic range and depth of vision of the human eye, advances in technology provide solutions for dynamic range, 360 degree vision and the handling of different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>The camera also has a night vision feature but just like daytime video recording, footages taken at night look a little underpowered. Pair your sensors with the Ooma Home Security app, and select your notification settings. When the monitoring station receives an alarm signal they can ring though to the premises, which in turn will switch the microphones on and allow them to listen quickly to any activity.</p>
