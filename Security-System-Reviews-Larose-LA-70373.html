<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>Burglar alarm circuits are triggered in a variety of ways. CCTV was initially developed as a means to increase security for banks but over time it has developed into a cost effective means of general video surveillance and home security. A single E-Series can scale to over 1.4PB, and when integrated as part of a video management solution, can provide multipetabyte scale.</p>

DVRs work similar to VCRs, but the images they capture from the CCTV camera is digital.</p>

Vijayawada: The locked house monitoring system (LHMS), which was launched in September, 2017, has barely reached out to the public in the city.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that machine learning systems soak up the racial and sexist prejudices of the society that programs them — from image recognition software that always puts women in kitchens , to criminal justice systems that always say black people are more likely to re-offend If we train AI surveillance system using old footage, like from CCTV or police body cameras, then biases that exist in society are likely to be perpetuated.</p>

Key features that set apart the best home security cameras include night vision, notification alerts, plenty of storage (either locally or in the cloud) for your recorded footage, and microphones to give out voice commands. This is based on user preference, but many security systems are most commonly controlled by a smartphone app, so often times it is sufficient (and easier for guests) to just have a keypad and then utilize the app for controlling the system on a day-to-day basis.</p>
