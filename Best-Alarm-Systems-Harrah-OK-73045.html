<p>Some security cameras have very high quality images, so you don't have to stare at fuzzy pictures you can't make out. Based around the Hub, you get a Multi Sensor, for doors and windows, a Motion Sensor, Presence Sensor that lets you know people arrive or leave home and a Power Outlet plug that controls anything plugged into it.

Finally, a power lead 30 serves to connect the circuitry to the positive battery terminal 12 so that the circuitry will have operating power.</p>
