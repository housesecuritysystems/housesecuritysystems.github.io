On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the CMS (Central Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>
<p>However, important questions need to be addressed before uncritically accepting the routine surveillance of public spaces, including whether video surveillance is an effective remedy for crime prevention and deterrence and whether it is an appropriate security measure in terms of civil liberties protections. However, as a user, you have to subscribe to the professional monitoring service.</p>
