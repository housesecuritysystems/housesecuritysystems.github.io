<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>From knowing when someone uses the front door to checking in on that leaky faucet, Ooma Smart Security keeps you updated on the things that matter most at home. No, not all providers offer security cameras in their equipment packages. Sometimes it's helpful to be able to see what happened just before or after a visitor approaches your door.
