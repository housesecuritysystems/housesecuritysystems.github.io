Another feature of intruder alarm systems include motion sensors. Around 170 million surveillance cameras are estimated to be present in China.</p>

It will alert you on your smartphone and email if there is an unnatural motion in the periphery of the camera.</p>

<p>In Wireless Systems , the principle is the same except no wires are required to connect the sensor to the Control Unit.

You can monitor these systems yourself using a mobile app, but many DIY companies also offer flexible, no-contract professional monitoring plans.</p>
<p>Google is also adding a bunch of new smarts to Nest Aware, including the ability to monitor your home using audio picked up by Nest smart speakers, so that a smoke alarm or glass-breaking sound will send an alert to the Google Home app. Computers are used on the network to store the cctv camera images but with the flexibility of IP CCTV, the cctv cameras could be located on opposite sides of the world.</p>
