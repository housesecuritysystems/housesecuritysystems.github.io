A physical attack could be accompanied by a cyber attack on the video surveillance infrastructure, as a means of compromising the ability of the latter to detect the physical security incident.</p>
<p>The Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera has an impressive motion detection feature. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY option. Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it allows you to control almost every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's highly customizable.</p>
<p>The high definition IP Camera with Wide Angle access and Multiview feature never lets you miss any corner. Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away” or Stay” mode. If there is no internet, the camera stores the video feed on the camera's micro SD card where you can access it from your smartphone and view it at your convenience. Right now Nest Secure has a few gaps in its security features (like an alarm that automatically delays by 30 seconds), but it's still worth considering—especially if all you need is basic home security that you can monitor yourself.</p>
