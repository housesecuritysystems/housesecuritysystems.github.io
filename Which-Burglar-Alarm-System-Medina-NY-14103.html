<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>

<p>Along with fire safety measures (if the indoor temperature reaches 60 degrees or above, an alarm will sound and the lock will automatically release), it also provides extra anti-theft security (an alarm goes off if the door is unlocked from the inside when you're not at home) and an automatic locking function that means you'll never forget to lock the door again.</p>
<p>As for the wearable cameras, it's hard to spot them if someone is recording you. Learn how to use a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino to develop a system for monitoring and controlling your home. Use the ADT mobile app to view your security cameras through your mobile device.
