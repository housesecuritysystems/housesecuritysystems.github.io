<p>Tamil Nadu, though a bigger State in terms of area and population when compared to Telangana, stands second with 40,112 CCTV cameras. So, in this post, we're gonna talk about the methods in detail to record your security cameras to those recorders. When added to a burglar alarm system, this provides extra assurance that advertent and inadvertent attempts to compromise the alarm communication channel between a protected property and its monitoring station won't go undetected.</p>
