<p>It the ray of light was broken, if even for a moment, the current stopped flowing and an alarm sounded. ADT Control is compatible with more smart home devices including Amazon Alexa and video doorbell cameras. Create schedules for your security system and smart devices to perform actions at certain times, or in response to specific circumstances. Sadly, you cannot download the videos to your phone and you need to physically remove the micro SD card from the camera to store the feeds or make use of network storage to automate it. Xiaomi should think of this as an option for users to store the footage on their smartphones and update the app accordingly.</p>
<p>Arm and disarm your home security system, view live video feeds, lock or unlock your doors, and even adjust your smart thermostat directly from your phone. You can control the camera through Wi-Fi from anywhere in the world using your smartphone or tablet by installing the specific mobile app. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system protects against a burglar cutting a cable or from failures of an internet provider.</p>
