<p>Security and safety products such as basic burglar alarm systems , door and window detectors , motion detectors and sirens , are critical components in many security systems. You can also automate your home alarm system to send you email alerts when specific events happen, such as certain doors opening or closing or an alarm being turned off. A burglar alarm system consists of a series of electrical components that are connected to a property.</p>
<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Our door and window alarms help detect break-ins, and our optional glass break sensors are prepared for all situations; if intruders bypass the usual sensors by breaking the glass as opposed to picking the locks, the glass break sensors will sound an alarm.</p>
