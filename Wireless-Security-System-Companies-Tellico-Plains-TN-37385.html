<p>For more sensitive control of the door, there is an advanced version called Balanced Magnetic Switch, in which the electrical contact of the switch is held in no-alarm condition by two magnets - one is fixed to the door frame and the other magnet is fixed to the corresponding position on to the door. DVRs capture footage from analog cameras in a digital format at the desired resolution and frames per second.</p>
<p>Environments with more stringent security requirements (for example, schools, public buildings, and airports) rely on 24Ã—7 video streams with higher resolution, and more frames per second to better identify suspicious persons and activity. Security systems have recently adopted cellular technology, making them easier than ever to install without professional help.</p>
<p>Several CCTV cameras can be integrated into your smart home, linking up with tech such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Most of the sensors detect opening of a door, window or breakage of glass or movement of human beings. Then, when the light beam is intercepted, the grid voltage is permitted to go to a high negative value, thereby cutting off the plate current and operating the alarm or indicator relay.</p>
