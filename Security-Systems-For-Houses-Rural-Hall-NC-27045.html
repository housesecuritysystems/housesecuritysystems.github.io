<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>Other companies, like SimpliSafe and ADT, also offer some type of camera. Landline, broadband, and cellular monitoring are different ways your home security system can be connected to the monitoring center. Another object of the invention is to prol vide a burglar alarm system equi ped with suitable light-sensitive devices, e ectrically connected so that any one obstructingralysf t e of light falling upon selected parts system, will involuntarily cause the system 9 to operate.</p>

<p>There are also rising concerns over people's privacy that is interrupted by excessive use of CCTV cameras worldwide. A more affordable alternative to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include many of the same features as their monitored counterpart, including sensors, alarms, and cameras, but they are not observed by a security service, meaning homeowners will not be paying the costly monthly expenses associated with monitored security systems.</p>
