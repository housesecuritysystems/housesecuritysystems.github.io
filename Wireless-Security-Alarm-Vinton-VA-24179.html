<p>Emergency dialer: If you don't want to connect to a monitoring service, buy a dialer and program it to call and play a recorded message to neighbors and friends to notify them of an alarm at your home.

<p>Covert CCTV is the practice of using video cameras in locations that are not made obvious to the persons being monitored in the specific cctv camera coverage area, but it is recommended that there is reasonable cause for the purpose of covert surveillance and that its primary objectives are clearly noted, only used for the purposes of preventing crime and are not used for longer than intended.</p>
<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
