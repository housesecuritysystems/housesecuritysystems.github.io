Manufacturers promote the use of spy cameras for various applications with the advent of AI, BIG data analytics, cloud computing, and face recognition options.

Most of the sensors detect opening of a door, window or breakage of glass or movement of human beings. Then, when the light beam is intercepted, the grid voltage is permitted to go to a high negative value, thereby cutting off the plate current and operating the alarm or indicator relay.</p>
