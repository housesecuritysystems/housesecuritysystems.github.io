<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The main difference between the two is that the Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera has a more robust design and is built to be weatherproof, rain or shine. This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market. Among the various criteria that impact surveillance network video recorder (NVR) system value, storage capacity can be particularly significant and easily misunderstood.</p>
<p>In a web demo, IC Realtime CEO Matt Sailor showed The Verge a version of Ella hooked up to around 40 cameras surveilling an industrial park. Alexa Guard integrates with your ADT smart security system. And if you decide you need more protection, it's easy to add Brinks professional monitoring to your Nest system. While the basics are the same, both are installed in your circuit breaker by attaching transformers to your power lines and allow real-time monitoring of consumption and generation, there are a few major differences.</p>

<p>For a common set up, where 4 cameras are shooting at 30 fps and an image resolution of 320 X 240 is being used, each camera only records when motion is on, and MPEG4 compression is used, users should be able fill up a 20 to 25 GB hard drive in about 80 hours. The resolution capability depends on how a particular CCTV camera is being used. Thanks to the rise in popularity of smart home technology, it's now easier than ever to secure your home with cameras, detectors, and sometimes even a control panel.</p>
