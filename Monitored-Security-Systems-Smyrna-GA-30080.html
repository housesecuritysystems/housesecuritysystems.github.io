<h2>Basic Home Security Smyrna Georgia</h2>
<p>Whether you need a system to protect your home or business, you can depend on surveillance video systems to document everything that happens on your property.

<p>For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage space for footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator. A pair of input leads, each lead being for connection to one of two spaced apart points of an electrical current loop including said electrical device, said points being selected to produce a detectable voltage between said input leads when current is drawn from said battery by said electrical device.</p>
