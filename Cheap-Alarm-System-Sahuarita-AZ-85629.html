<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Popular monitoring solutions include ADT, SimpliSafe, Ring, Nest, etc. When the magnetic connection is broken by opening a door or window that is protected, the alarm is triggered. I used a monitoring service from CardioNet for several years until my insurance decided they wouldn't cover it any more.
