<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>With cutting-edge AI algorithms and big data technology, Huawei Smart Traffic Video Surveillance Solution provides traffic violation recognition, and incident detection, for airports, railways, highways, and other transportation areas to simplify management and improve service quality, ensuring travelers have the most secure, efficient, and comfortable experience.</p>
