Unlike traditional CCTV cameras or home surveillance cameras, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen security. Abundant storage capacity is a fundamental enabler of such capabilities, and it is here that some video surveillance deployments can go amiss.</p>
<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
