Alternately, battery-operated remote wireless sensors and controls can be installed.</p>
<p>The main purpose of coming up with this project is to build an automatic greenhouse monitoring in which GSM module sends the information about temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture and status of appliances (fans, sprays, artificial lights and water pump) that are connected with circuit for controlling greenhouse effects or greenhouse parameters (temperature, humidity, light intensity and water supply for plants).</p>
<p>To address the privacy threats of smart camera networks, legislators should ban plug-in surveillance networks and restrict the scope of networked CCTVs beyond the premise of a single site. When a motion sensor detects motion in the room, it will automatically alert the control panel, setting off the alarm. These sensors detect infrared energy, enabling them to detect dramatic increases of heat in a room - such as would occur when a burglar enters an otherwise empty room.</p>

Ultra Series Controllers are composed of a master controller and three distributed access controllers.
