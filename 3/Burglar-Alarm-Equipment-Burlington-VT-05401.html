Companies can add detectors and sensors for fire, smoke, flood, carbon monoxide and even freezing pipes onto your monthly monitoring service for increased protection.

Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides up to 48 sensors in its basic package, including both fire and CO alarms.</p>
