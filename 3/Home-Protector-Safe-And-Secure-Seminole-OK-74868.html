The company focuses on smart security with Samsung's intelligent connectivity platform. All of Frontpoint's equipment is intended for simple do-it-yourself (DIY) installation.</p>
<p>If unauthorized entry to the engine compartment (or trunk) occurs, line 36 goes to a logic high level and sets flip-flop 74. The output of flip-flop 74 is directly connected to a second input of OR gate 90. This instantly activates sounding timer 92 and the alarm is sounded for two minutes until reset due to the action of one shot 94, as described above.</p>
<p>There are more than 10 types of security systems there like CCTV camera, PIR sensors, video door phone, digital safe, biometric door lock, etc. Time lapse VCR's allow cctv camera images to be recorded for varying lengths of time on a single 3 hour video tape, from lengths of 3 hours to over 960 hours.
