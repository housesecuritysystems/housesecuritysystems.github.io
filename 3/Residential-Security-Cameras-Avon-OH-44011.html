<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>We'll show you how a video surveillance system can help your business reduce loss, document events, improve employee safety, and gain visibility into your operations. They have indoor, outdoor, and doorbell camera options and advanced smart home capabilities. In case of a power loss, the back-up battery will activate to maintain your intruder alarm protection for several hours.</p>
