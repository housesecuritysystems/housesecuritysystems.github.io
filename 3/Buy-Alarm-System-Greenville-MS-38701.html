<p>That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire department—so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>

Typically, a CCTV security system with 4 dome cameras, 4 channel DVR with 1 TB hard disk costs around 15k to 20k depending on factors like where are you living, CCTV and the length of wire.

<p>CCTV cameras system recorders: DVR (digital video recorder) which record onto hard drives is the best option. For doors and windows switches are provided which are open as long as the door or window is closed, but which, on being released by opening the door or windows, automatically close the circuit.
