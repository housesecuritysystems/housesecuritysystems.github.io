ADT now offers a full DIY home security system called Blue by ADT Blue by ADT is the result of ADT's acquisition and merger with LifeShield. Customizable home security packages are available with professional monitoring or self-monitoring.</p>
<p>If you want to keep an eye on what's happening in your home when you're not there, but you don't want to invest in a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth a look.
