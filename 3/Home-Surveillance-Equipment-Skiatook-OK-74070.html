<p>Network cameras are ideal for both domestic and commercial purposes because you can see what's going on whilst away from the property.

<p>The small size and ease of deployment of many video components and the flexibility in transmission means over short and long distances has made rapid deployment equipment for portable personnel protection systems practical and important.
