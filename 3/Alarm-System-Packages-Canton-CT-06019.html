<p>Video transmission is the means of getting the video signal from the camera to the recording or monitoring device. This kit also includes a separate keypad, contact sensor for doors or windows, motion detector, and a Z-Wave range extender so that you have the flexibility to place the base station as far from the other sensors as necessary.
