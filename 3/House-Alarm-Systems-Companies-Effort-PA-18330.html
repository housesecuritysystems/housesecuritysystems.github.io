It's well worth investing time in researching home security systems in order to gain peace of mind knowing that you've chosen the right system to protect your home and family. Do I really need a home security system - while most people think of home security systems as a way to protect their homes from burglaries, what many people may not realize is that these systems can also protect homes from fires as well - a must, literally, to have a home security camera system.</p>
<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set amount of time, typically one to five years. To help you with this important decision, we'll run through all the key features of a home security system, discuss some important choices homeowners must make, and review the major companies offering systems, while first providing some of the main reasons your home may be at risk.</p>

Cables link different pieces of equipment together, including monitors, recorders, modems, and wired cameras.

<p>Instead of locking you into a multiyear contract with a broad coverage-based monthly fee, most DIY systems give you the flexibility to chose how and when you monitor your home. Wired home security installation costs start around $100, though some companies offer discount installations for new customers. ADT is the 800-pound gorilla in this market, but with good reason: It makes one of the best home security systems, offering several tiers of systems and services.</p>
