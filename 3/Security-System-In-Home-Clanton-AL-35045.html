<p>In addition, IP cameras are compatible with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer several other benefits over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. While there are many CCTV camera systems you can choose from, some of the main things to keep in mind include the resolution, sharpness, angle of coverage, and availability of Infrared (for night time), amongst others.</p>
<p>They are also called security alarms, security systems, alarm systems, intrusion detection systems, perimeter detection systems, and similar terms. Vivint wireless security camera systems can be outfitted with motion sensor technology that is both energy-efficient and more secure. The functionalities such as advanced software, third-party monitoring and analytics services, and wireless communicationâ€”are propelling the demand for the integrated home security systems.</p>

<h3>Trying to Outsmart a Home Security System in Clanton</h3>
<p>I claim: 1. In combination, a light source, an optical system for converting light from said source into two light beams, a pair of photo cells arranged to convert said light beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, and a semi-circular chopper so arranged with respect to said optical system that the sum of the cell outputs is constant and interception of a light beam will cause the output of said cells to have varying voltage, an am65 plifier connected to said photo cells and means connected thereto for operating an alarm system.</p>
<p>In place of the source of illumination 87 and cell 88 or in combination therewith and the other devices, we may employ a bulb or source of light 92 in combinatlon with alight-sensitive cell 94 connected through a battery 89 with an amplifier vacuum tube 95. From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>

<p>Basically two sensors are used, one is Motion Detector and other one Window Sensor. Magnetic switches are the most common sensing devices for sensing opening and closing of doors and windows. Most wireless CCTV cameras use the 2.4 Gigahertz frequencies to transmit their video images to a monitor or DVR (digital video recorder). The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.</p>
