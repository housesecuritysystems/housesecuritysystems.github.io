<p>Founded in 2004, Ohio AMS has been proudly serving Ohio's courts and corrections industry with high quality monitoring products and services for over a decade. Although entry and exit trigger times are customizable (up to 4 minutes, 15 seconds), the response time in our tests was always consistent: In every one of our tests, the COPS monitoring service called exactly 44 seconds after the alarm sounded. Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>
<p>Aside from receiving video clips whenever motion is detected, an alarm is activated, or a sensor is triggered, it's easy to schedule your surveillance system to automatically record at certain times. To deliver instant home insight, the camera has motion and temperature sensors. Stay mode will turn off all internal motion sensors but keeps door and window sensors active.</p>

<p>Whether you need a system to protect your home or business, you can depend on surveillance video systems to document everything that happens on your property.

Nest uses the same home alarm monitoring centers as Brinks, but the service comes with a lower monthly cost.</p>
