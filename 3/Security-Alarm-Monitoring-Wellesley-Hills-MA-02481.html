<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. North America maintains its supremacy in global CCTV camera market, Latin America to offer new revenue lines. Software is used on the local PC that allows access to the digital video recorder. More high-end equipment packages—like the ones Vivint Smart Home provides—come with a touch-screen control panel and the option to add outdoor home security cameras, all of which require professional installation.</p>
<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>

<p>The surveillance system consists of a CCTV camera with the motion sensor, a power cord for the camera, a data card for internet, an alarm and an UPS for power backup.

Few cameras were placed in public, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations.</p>
<p>Network Video Recorders (NVR) and analog recorders (VCRs), also available for purchase, work the same way as a DVR, using an internet signal (NVR) or blank tapes (VCR) to record instead of a digital hard-drive. This interest is largely due to increased crime rates and security threats all around the globe, which are driving a continuous growth of the video surveillance market.</p>
<p>The evolution of deep neural networks can be directly exploited in video surveillance systems to endow them with exceptional intelligence and enable more effective surveillance processes. By this solution we can save the cost of extra cable ( as cat5e cable is transmitting both video & power) and no separate power outlet is required for cameras.
