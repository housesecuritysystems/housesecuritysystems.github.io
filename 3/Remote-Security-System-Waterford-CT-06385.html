In particular, the video surveillance industry offers an interesting perspective into the state of this field's cybersecurity stance.</p>

Now, most security systems involve a great number of components, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, among other components.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
