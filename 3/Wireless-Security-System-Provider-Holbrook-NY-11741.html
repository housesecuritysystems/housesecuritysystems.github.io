Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips.

<p>In place of the source of illumination 87 and cell 88 or in combination therewith and the other devices, we may employ a bulb or source of light 92 in combinatlon with alight-sensitive cell 94 connected through a battery 89 with an amplifier vacuum tube 95. From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>
<p>The output of discharge comparator 40 is connected to a first input of an OR gate 76. The output of OR gate 76 is connected to the set input of flip-flop 72. Thus, once the system is armed, any discharge of current which causes a sufficient drop across battery cable 24 to change the state of discharge comparator 40 produces an output which is supplied to the set input of flip-flop 72.</p>

<p>Therefore, with the increasing penetration of home security systems, the DIY systems become an attractive alternative for newer customers with average disposable incomes. Though some burglar alarms are successfully triggered by the unexpected motion caused by break-ins, studies have shown that an audible alarm may not always have the intended effect. In general, the customer reviews regarding the quality of service are positive, which can sometimes be hard to find in the home security business.</p>
