This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market. Among the various criteria that impact surveillance network video recorder (NVR) system value, storage capacity can be particularly significant and easily misunderstood.</p>

The first signal sent by your control panel will alert monitoring personnel at the central station, who will call to notify you and confirm whether it's a real emergency or a false trigger. The Ultra Series is designed for extensive projects that require a large number of cameras, as well as a rack-mounted installation for back-end NVRs.</p>
