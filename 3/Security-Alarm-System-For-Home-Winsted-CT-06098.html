<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. It offers indoor cameras, which aren't on a par with our camera picks but allow for Visual Verification, an opt-in feature that permits the monitoring service to view live video in your home to confirm there's an actual emergency before calling the cavalry—a system intended to reduce false alerts (and, as noted above, a requirement in some communities).</p>
<p>The camera also has a night vision feature but just like daytime video recording, footages taken at night look a little underpowered. Pair your sensors with the Ooma Home Security app, and select your notification settings. When the monitoring station receives an alarm signal they can ring though to the premises, which in turn will switch the microphones on and allow them to listen quickly to any activity.</p>
