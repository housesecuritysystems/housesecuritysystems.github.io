When comparing prices for home security, include any expenses for equipment, installation, activation and monitoring.</p>
<p>If you add monitoring, fees will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. Many security companies outsource their monitoring to a 3rd party dispatch. Frontpoint offers five plans , all of which include professional monitoring for $35-$40 per month. To research the best security system for your needs, consider whether you require video monitoring, you want voice recognition features, and how technically savvy you are about managing your system.</p>
<p>It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing.
