<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>A team of three to four installers will need to install cameras, the system panel, and additional equipment (depending on what's included in each custom package).
