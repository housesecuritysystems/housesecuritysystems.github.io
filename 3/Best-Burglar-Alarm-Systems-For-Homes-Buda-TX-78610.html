<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Our door and window alarms help detect break-ins, and our optional glass break sensors are prepared for all situations; if intruders bypass the usual sensors by breaking the glass as opposed to picking the locks, the glass break sensors will sound an alarm.</p>
<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
