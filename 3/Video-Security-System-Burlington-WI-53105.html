<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>At 3 is a fiash panA on the interior of the casing but rojectin to a slight extent to the outsi e thereo through an opening 4. The casing has an aperture 5 in line with the camera 2, and at 6 (Fi ure 5) is an audible alarm device connecte to the electrical operatin circuit so that the alarm can be sounde at the moment the camera 2 takes the picture.</p>
<h2>Home Security Provider Burlington Wisconsin</h2>

<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
