<p>Panasonic, leading the global security industry for 60 years, will continue to provide world-top-class innovative intelligent AI security solutions supported by Panasonic unique video capturing x sensing” technology for a safer tomorrow. As previously mentioned, CCTV DVRs have a multiplexer built in which enables the user to view multiple images on the screen at any given time by segregating the screen image. The result is the broadest security infrastructure portfolio available from any single vendor, from high-performance NVRs, to hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), to the largest shared storage and archive solutions, to analytics processing.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time.
