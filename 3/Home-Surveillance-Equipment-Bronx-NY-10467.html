<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Offers may not be combined with certain other promotional offers on the same services and may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. Most security systems require a monthly payment for monitoring and a one-time payment for the equipment. You do not want to have a long entry time as a burglar entering through a delay zone has the same amount of time in your protected area before the alarm goes off.</p>
<p>However, combined with the compatible locks, alarms, webcams and sensors, you can create a seriously secure home. It also offers different monitoring plans based on the desired connectivity - landline, broadband or cellular. While less expensive security cameras have single duplex audio — meaning you can talk and listen, but only one at a time — full-duplex audio — both sides can talk and listen simultaneously is even better.</p>
