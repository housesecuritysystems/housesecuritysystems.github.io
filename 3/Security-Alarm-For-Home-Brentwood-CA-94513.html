<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Vivint makes cutting-edge security cameras for indoor and outdoor use. It is common for companies to charge a separate fee for monitoring services. Most of today's home security systems will offer some degree of smart home integration and it's a worthwhile add-on or enhancement for more complete control of many working parts of the home. Join up surveillance efforts and quickly analyze data to deliver timely monitoring and surveillance across your security landscape.</p>
