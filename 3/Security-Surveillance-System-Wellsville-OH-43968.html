Hi, Daniel, both Reolink battery-powered security cameras and plugged-in type security cameras will keep recording if there is constant activity in the monitoring area.</p>
<p>Although many video surveillance cameras appear to be similar and provide the same specifications, they aren't the same. The company provides a dedicated customer service line along with a personal home security portal, where you can log in and ask for help if you need it. However, the main issue most customers encounter with this company is the aggressive sales tactics used by the company's reps.</p>
<p>As adjuncts to the system the treads of the stairs are sometimes arranged to ring the bell, by completing a circuit when trod on. Door mats are also arranged to close circuits in like manner.

Brinks has pretty standard equipment, but we love its smart monitoring alerts.</p>
