However, it has no self-monitoring option: If you cancel, you lose monitoring, remote access, and all smartphone alerts, though the sensors and sirens will still work, so you can at least set an alarm when you're home at night.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on.
