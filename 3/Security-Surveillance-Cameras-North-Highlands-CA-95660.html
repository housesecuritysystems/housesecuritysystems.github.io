<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Though these surveillance cameras have relatively discrete appearance, it still has a great effect in deterring criminals. Most frequently it is used in video surveillance systems and can provide a storage of 2 TB to 4 TB. The system is also subject to false alarms resulting from automobile headlights, lightning flashes and so forth, entering the receiver. Our local reseller offers several levels of service, each of which offers different features, but with a similar up-front cost of about $300.</p>
<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike. Founded in 1999, Vivint has positioned itself as a next generation home security services provider with an emphasis on home automation and integration with smart home devices.</p>

Also within the IP video surveillance market, we are interested in certain vertical market studies like: Retail, Transportation, Industrial, Logistics, and Residential.</p>
<p>The self-monitored plan offers no monitoring support, meaning tripped alarms make noise but won't connect with local emergency services. Many high resolution color cameras now use an IR cut-filter for built-in night vision. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts).</p>

Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
