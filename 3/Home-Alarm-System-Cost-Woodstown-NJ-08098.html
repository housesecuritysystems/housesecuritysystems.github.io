To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>

This includes access to the ADT Pulse smartphone app, which is available for iOS and Android This doesn't work with smart home voice systems like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, though.</p>
<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday.

Multiple Users viewing: Multiple users could watch the live video from the same camera at the same time, clearly and smoothly.</p>
<p>In some cases, the salespeople use high-pressure or deceptive sales tactics to get potential customers to buy expensive, and sometimes substandard, systems or equipment they don't need.

ADT's response time averages a respectable 45 seconds, and they have multiple monitoring centers so their reliability is second to none.</p>
