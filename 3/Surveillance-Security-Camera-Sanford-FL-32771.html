<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
