<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>

Or, you may want to up the ante by installing a complex closed circuit television (CCTV) which features digital recorders, multiple operators, and several cameras.
