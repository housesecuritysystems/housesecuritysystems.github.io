<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Nest security partners with Brinks, an award-winning alarm service, to provide professional emergency monitoring. After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app ‘EZVIZ' by the house owners. Electronic surveillance of employees also ensures your floor manager get more time to work on the critical aspects of their work rather than focusing their entire attention on monitoring people.</p>
<p>Both types of security cameras can be purchased as standalone units, complete with either a monitoring app or a subscription-based monitoring system. See the benefits of enabling edge-based storage in VSaaS applications and the value proposition of Micron's surveillance-grade edge storage solutions.

It's professionally installed, it will look good in your house, and it supports a ton of smart home devices. The Eufy Security app also offers the ability to set activity zones, so you can draw a box on the screen to specify the area you're interested in. This is vital if you have a camera that overlooks a busy road, for example.</p>
