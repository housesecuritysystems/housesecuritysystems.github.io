<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get fully featured, professional-grade security solutions that are easy to install and simple to use. According to a recent report by Mordor Intelligence, the video surveillance market was valued at $29.98 billion in 2016, and is expected to reach a value of $72.19 billion by 2022. DIY home security systems are typically less expensive than traditional systems because you can cut out the cost of professional installation and potentially monitoring as well.</p>
<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>

If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>Easy DIY installation: The company's wireless systems are plug-and-protect — easy to install in less than an hour, even without a professional.
