A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Security lights are very useful to scare the intruders especially if these lights are employed in the compound or on the roof tops. You can choose from our Expert Approved security DVR recorder , and IP camera NVR , or Tribrid DVR that's perfect for you, as well as our many CCTV cameras and accessories to configure the perfect system for your needs.

If the invisible energy is to be used the color filter 2 is interposed between the light source I and lens 3. Lenses 6 and 7 divide the light from the source I into two light beams which are directed to the photoelectric cells 9 and 10. A light chopper driven by the motor II is arranged to chop both of the light beams in such a manner that the output of the photoelectric cells 9 and 10 always has a constant voltage.</p>
<p>To gauge reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensors. Simply go to one of the video surveillance storage matrix tables to select the table row that lists the frame resolution and fps needed for each 24×7 video stream, then read across to find the nearest desired archival period (shown in days) and the corresponding drive capacity required for each individual stream.</p>
