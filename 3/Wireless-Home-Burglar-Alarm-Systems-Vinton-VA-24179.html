<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately. Usually, they are black and white cameras that do not have very high resolution. Real-time alarm notifications, sirens, video recording, and easy viewing make it one of the best home security systems in the Indian market.</p>
<p>Cost-effective network video recording servers. We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Kit because it includes all the basics (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a few extra entry sensors.

Until now, going digital has meant negotiating a raft of contracts between security, storage and data center vendors and forging complex IT strategies.</p>
<p>Security: There have been plenty of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, baby monitors, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so be sure to check what steps has each manufacturer taken to eliminate this problem.
