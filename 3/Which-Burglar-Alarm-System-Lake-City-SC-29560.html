A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>7. In combination, an enclosure having an opening therein, a light source for projecting a beam across said opening, an optical system arranged to divide the light from said source into two beams, means for receiving said light beams and converting said beams into electrical energy of constant voltage, a light chopper arranged so that the output of said receiving means is constant and to vary the voltage of said energy when one of said beams is intercepted by an intruder and means responsive to the varying volt- 85 age for operating an alarm system.</p>
