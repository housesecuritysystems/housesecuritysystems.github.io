<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft.

<p>The main purpose of coming up with this project is to build an automatic greenhouse monitoring in which GSM module sends the information about temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture and status of appliances (fans, sprays, artificial lights and water pump) that are connected with circuit for controlling greenhouse effects or greenhouse parameters (temperature, humidity, light intensity and water supply for plants).</p>
<p>If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras should be able to provide you with the necessary information. Videos from both IP cameras and analog cameras can be transferred over the computer network whereas unlike analog cameras, IP cameras can connect directly to an IP network.
