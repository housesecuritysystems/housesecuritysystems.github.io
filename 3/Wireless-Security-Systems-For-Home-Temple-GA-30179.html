<p>It does feel more like a smart-home control system than a dedicated security platform, but hopefully things will change once the cameras join the party.

<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Our door and window alarms help detect break-ins, and our optional glass break sensors are prepared for all situations; if intruders bypass the usual sensors by breaking the glass as opposed to picking the locks, the glass break sensors will sound an alarm.</p>
