Many providers have a mobile app that you can install for remotely managing your home security system, checking cameras, and checking notifications.</p>
<p>Instead of locking you into a multiyear contract with a broad coverage-based monthly fee, most DIY systems give you the flexibility to chose how and when you monitor your home. Wired home security installation costs start around $100, though some companies offer discount installations for new customers.
