Security is crucial in a crisis, but smart home equipment comes in handy every single day. When you're thinking about alarm systems, you might instantly start wondering whether to go for a DIY set-up or to call in the professionals. Last but definitely not the least is Blink's very own Home Security Camera System with Motion Detection, HD Video, Battery and Cloud Storage for Smartphones.</p>

Using the garage door controller, manage your garage using the Vivint Smart Home app and receive notifications if your garage door is open or if it failed to close.</p>
