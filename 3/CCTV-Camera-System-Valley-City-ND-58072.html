Our trained professionals monitor sensors only (i.e. door and window sensors, flood sensors).

<p>Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>
<p>Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring fees. You have super full HD quality, easy to install, easy to connect to your Ethernet, real-time recording and you will have 2 external hard drives for storage.
