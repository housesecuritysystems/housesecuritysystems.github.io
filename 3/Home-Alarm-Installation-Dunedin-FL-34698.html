<p>IP cameras are far more powerful than analog cameras, usually shooting footage of between 1 megapixel and 5 megapixels. Ring Alarm Security System packs the power of whole-home security into an affordable, DIY package.

<p>An analogue or digital camera connected to a video server acts as a network camera, but the image size is restricted to that of the video standard of the camera. DIY security systems are often preferable for renters because they are more portable and can easily be moved into a new home. Also within the IP video surveillance market, we are interested in certain vertical market studies like: Retail, Transportation, Industrial, Logistics, and Residential.</p>

<p>The Nest Cam Indoor Security Camera has an impressive motion detection feature. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY option. Depending on how expansive the area is that you want to cover, the resolution of the CCTV camera you choose will need to reflect the landscape in order to provide a clear, useful image.

<p>To gauge reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensors. Simply go to one of the video surveillance storage matrix tables to select the table row that lists the frame resolution and fps needed for each 24×7 video stream, then read across to find the nearest desired archival period (shown in days) and the corresponding drive capacity required for each individual stream.</p>
