<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. Video surveillance, access control and alarms have much in common, and they often work together as an integrated system to keep intruders out of secure areas, limit access to security sensitive areas, and remotely monitor critical areas to reduce the risk of crime and security incidents.

<p>And sometimes, motion sensors can do the job of several entry sensors. This way you can talk with the company's Central Monitoring Station directly through the panel, and cut down the response time in half. On detecting any intrusion or fire or possible threat to the premise, the control panel sends the signal to the EMS (Eurovigil Monitoring Station) and raises a loud alarm through a hooter simultaneously.</p>

The camera quality is good for all 4 cameras and recording is running well. It was further stated that private entities installed CCTV cameras voluntarily or on the directions of police.</p>
