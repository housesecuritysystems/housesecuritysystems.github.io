<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Quick action is important during break-ins, and burglar alarms facilitate fast response by alerting people in the vicinity to compromised security as soon as it occurs. The major drawback of IP cameras is their higher price tag.
