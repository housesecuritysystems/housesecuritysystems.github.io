To view live or recorded footage from your security cameras, you must hook up your DVR or NVR to a TV or monitor.</p>
<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
