<p>Some security cameras have very high quality images, so you don't have to stare at fuzzy pictures you can't make out. Based around the Hub, you get a Multi Sensor, for doors and windows, a Motion Sensor, Presence Sensor that lets you know people arrive or leave home and a Power Outlet plug that controls anything plugged into it. The second connection is a sense input along line 28 to the negative terminal of the battery to pick up the voltage drop across battery cable 24. Finally, a power lead 30 serves to connect the circuitry to the positive battery terminal 12 so that the circuitry will have operating power.</p>
<p>Choose from a wide portfolio of products, including analog & IP cameras, body worn solutions, covertcameras, time & attendance solutions, home automation solutions, video door phones, and related accessories. Hybrid digital video recorders (HDVRs) support IP cameras.
