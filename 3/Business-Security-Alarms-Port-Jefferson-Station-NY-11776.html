Manufacturers promote the use of spy cameras for various applications with the advent of AI, BIG data analytics, cloud computing, and face recognition options. However, factors such as high investment cost and lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras, hamper the market growth.</p>
<p>DVRs evolved from the older VCR models, while NVRs represent the next step in the evolution of video recording technology. With homes that use additional home security measures 5 times less likely to be burgled, a visible home alarm is a sound investment. The intrusion monitoring service is included in all our packages.
