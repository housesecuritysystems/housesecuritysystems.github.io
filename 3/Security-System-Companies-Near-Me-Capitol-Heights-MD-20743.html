<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. Video surveillance, access control and alarms have much in common, and they often work together as an integrated system to keep intruders out of secure areas, limit access to security sensitive areas, and remotely monitor critical areas to reduce the risk of crime and security incidents. You can also check out our guide to the best home security cameras for more options.</p>

Until now, going digital has meant negotiating a raft of contracts between security, storage and data center vendors and forging complex IT strategies.</p>
<p>Nest is pricier than most other DIY home security systems, but it's a good choice if you want to monitor your system yourself.
