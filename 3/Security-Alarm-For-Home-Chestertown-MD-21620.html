While having the monitoring data from RPA's Passive House projects will be very useful, it will be even more valuable to aggregate the data from all PHIUS certified Passive House projects into a single repository so we can compare information across climate zones furthering the climate adaptive standards.</p>
<p>All Blue by ADT equipment and services are compatible with LifeShield systems. Some DIY systems are self-monitored, which means you'll receive alerts when devices are triggered, but it's up to you to contact the local authorities if there's a break-in or a fire. Our data management solutions excel in both, helping you to reduce storage costs and network strain without compromising the video quality you rely on for effective security.</p>
