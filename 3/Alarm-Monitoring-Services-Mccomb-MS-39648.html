<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Nest security partners with Brinks, an award-winning alarm service, to provide professional emergency monitoring. After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app ‘EZVIZ' by the house owners. Electronic surveillance of employees also ensures your floor manager get more time to work on the critical aspects of their work rather than focusing their entire attention on monitoring people.</p>
<p>You use this cost-effective indoor motion sensor along with a SkylinkHome receiver to ensure lights are activated any time motion is detected in the room. In 2019, of the total 4.27 Lakh CCTV cameras used by the police in the country, more than 2.75 Lakh cameras or 64.4% of the total, were installed in Telangana. Bright light causes glare and high contrast in your footage, which makes it hard to tell what's going on. Consider the movement of the sun and angle your cameras for indirect light.</p>
