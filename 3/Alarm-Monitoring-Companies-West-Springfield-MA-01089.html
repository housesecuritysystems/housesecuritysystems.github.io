<p>When security companies offer a promotion, we're on it. We regularly update our site with current security system promotions, and we even offer exclusive deals from time to time. Security lights get switched on whenever it detects an intruder within its field of view. When contacted, RPF Assistant Security Commissioner BK Makraria told Sakal Times that the matter has been forwarded to the city police and a case has been registered with the Bund Garden police station.</p>
