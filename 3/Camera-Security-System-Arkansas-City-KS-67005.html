The wireless access to several security options—such as access control, and fire and gas detection systems—offers flexibility, convenience, and assurance to consumers.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system.

Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
<p>Compared to equipment offered by other home security providers, Protect America's may not be the most impressive, but their door and windows sensors, indoor and outdoor cameras and glass-break detectors are all sturdy and functional. Smart city projects have created a huge demand for the surveillance market.
