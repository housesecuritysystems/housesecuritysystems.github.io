<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>

You do not want to have a long entry time as a burglar entering through a delay zone has the same amount of time in your protected area before the alarm goes off.</p>

Frames per Second: Frames per second is the amount of full frames that a video camera captures and sends to a recording device or monitor per second. The company relies on long-term contracts (although they do offer discounts along with some long-term contracts), offers no professional installation option, no landline option, and has the highest monthly monitoring fees of all the companies we reviewed.</p>
<p>Fort Knox® has worked hard to gain a good reputation with our Houston customers as a company with low rates and quick response times, thanks to our technicians with 20+ years of experience, and our company-owned monitoring center.
