AxxonSoft is a leading developer of Video Management and Physical Security Information Management software. However, it has no self-monitoring option: If you cancel, you lose monitoring, remote access, and all smartphone alerts, though the sensors and sirens will still work, so you can at least set an alarm when you're home at night.</p>
