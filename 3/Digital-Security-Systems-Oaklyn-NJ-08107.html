<p>The best in smart home security systems. Our systems are highly customizable for a variety of HD camera system and monitor configurations. Finally, the key component that makes Vivint's wireless home surveillance systems more convenient than any other - remote access. Although the systems do not provide a connection with a professional monitoring station, the customers can remotely monitor the home using their smartphones.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras. These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible.</p>
