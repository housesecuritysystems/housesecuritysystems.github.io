<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions.

This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter.</p>
