<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>This is sold as the Nest Secure alarm system, commanding a premium fee of $399, and it includes a base station, two Nest Tags, and two sensors. Commercial and government sectors would be key end users of CCTV cameras; residential sector to represent potential growth avenues. There are more than 25 million operational CCTV cameras globally, and experts believe that around 67% of the burglaries taking place in businesses could be avoided by installing real-time security measures such as CCTV monitoring.</p>

Video surveillance is an important application that utilizes shared storage resources.

Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras.
