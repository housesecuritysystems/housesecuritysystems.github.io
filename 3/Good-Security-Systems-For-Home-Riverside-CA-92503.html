<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. That's especially true if you've already sunk money into other Nest gear like the thermostat or cameras Instead of getting a separate security system, you can get one that syncs with your current equipment and uses the same app you're already used to. The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on.
