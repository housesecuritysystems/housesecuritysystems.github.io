<p>The output of discharge comparator 40 is connected to a first input of an OR gate 76. The output of OR gate 76 is connected to the set input of flip-flop 72.

<p>If looking for a brand new system, check out our "Green Line" and "Blue Line" Series IP Systems. If the battery is relatively stable, and the thresholds for discharge comparator 40 and charge comparator 42 are properly set, successful sensing of alarm conditions will occur, without activation by changes in battery voltage not due to unauthorized entry.
