Pricing for DIY security systems varies from company to company and will depend on the size of your home and the number of sensors and add-on components that you order.

If the output of flip-flop 72 drops to a zero logic level before timeout of entry delay timer 86, then no output pulse is provided by timer 86 and no alarm is sounded.</p>
