<p>AxxonSoft's video surveillance systems virtually support the entire Axis product line of network cameras and video servers. If you think you're satisfied with the cloud services, you can go for the optional monthly plans which provide extended cloud storage at a fraction of the cost of traditional home monitoring systems.

<p>Concerns have also been raised on the firm being owned by the Chinese government, adding a twist to the controversy over a Delhi government project to install 1.5 lakh CCTV cameras across the city. Smaller cameras like video doorbells and peephole cameras frequently use batteries, which is even more user-friendly. It also supports Zigbee and Z-Wave, which means you can connect the system to a wide variety of third-party devices so you can control everything from within the Abode app.</p>
<p>Ring currently offers doorbell cameras, exterior lighting cameras, and plenty of accessories to complement their smarthome doorbells.
