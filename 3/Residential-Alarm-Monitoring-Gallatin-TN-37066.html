<h3>Home Security Systems: More Than Simply Having An Alarm In Place in Gallatin</h3>
<p>A simple user interface enables customers to easily arm and disarm their system, view status of doors, control lights, thermostats, door locks and see live video from cameras in and around the home - all at the touch of a button. The video surveillance market comprises several stakeholders, such as cameras, storage devices, manufacturers and suppliers, software players, and service providers.</p>
<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
<p>If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly.

<p>Once it's installed, you'll get alerts whenever the camera's motion sensors goes off, and you can see who's at your door and talk to them through the camera mic. Some add Bluetooth for local control and easier setup through your smartphone, while others incorporate separate home automation networking standards to interact with other devices, like Zigbee or Z-Wave.</p>
