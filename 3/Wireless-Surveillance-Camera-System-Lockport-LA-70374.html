If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house.

Today's technology permits the viewing of video images on personal digital assistants and cell phones.</p>
