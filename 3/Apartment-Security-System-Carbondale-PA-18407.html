SimpliSafe has earned this spot with easy DIY setup, fast response times, and an impressive lineup of home automation features. With Vivint wireless security camera systems, there are no wires to alert intruders that they are being monitored, and the network signal will still transmit even if the power goes out. The associated technology is transitioning from standalone and analog video to networked (IP) and digital video.</p>

Ensure that your mounting equipment is strong enough to bear the weight of the camera, especially when there are movable parts in cameras that cover a wide area. Set one phone as the Viewer and one as the Camera, and enjoy simple security.</p>

ADT home security also works with Amazon Alexa for hands-free voice control of your home's security. It consists of an intelligent 3-zone Main control panel and a range of detectors and sensors such as magnetic door sensors, Motion sensors, Vibration sensors, Glass break sensors, Panic switch (Hand operated or foot operated), and Smoke detectors (Photo thermal, Photoelectric or Heat).</p>
