<p>All plans include a control panel hub, motion detector, yard sign, door and window stickers and door and window sensors. That are installed on a property; personal security involves practices such as ensuring doors are locked, alarms activated, windows closed, extra keys not hidden outside, etc. To protect our customers and employees, Xfinity Home, security equipment and services are not available for purchase at this time.</p>
