With DIY systems, you order everything online and the company ships you the equipment along with step-by-step installation instructions. Skimping on door and window sensors is the biggest mistake DIYers make. Based on a standard called CP-01-2000, developed by the American National Standards Institute and Security Industry Association, the new generation of keypad control panels takes aim at user error by building in extra precautions that minimize unwarranted dispatch of emergency responders.</p>

Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch.
