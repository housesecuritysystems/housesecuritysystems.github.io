<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors. Today, the most pop recorders include an NVR (Network Video Recorder), a DVR (Digital Video Recorder), a computer (the hard drive on the computer actually), a Micro SD card, the FTP server, and Cloud.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation — well, there really wasn't much in the automation department. Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>

We evaluate these security cameras not just based on their popularity but also on their pricing, design, setup process, set of features, and overall value.

Window foil is a less sophisticated, mostly outdated detection method that involves gluing a thin strip of conducting foil on the inside of the glass and putting low-power electric current through it. Breaking the glass is practically guaranteed to tear the foil and break the circuit.</p>

Advertised regular price of Smart Home Monitoring plan applies in month 25, subject to any applicable rate increases.
