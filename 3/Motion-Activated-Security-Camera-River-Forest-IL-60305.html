<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>And they won't use your WiFi or slow it down unless you access the security cameras for remote viewing or the cameras send you alerts when motion is detected. With ADT home security packages, you get more than just a smart security system. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks. Bottom Line: Vivint is a high-end wireless system that offers same day professional installation.</p>
