Introduction of special solar cameras to cater to the remote locations demands integration of new technologies to provide a bigger data resource for smooth functioning of the monitoring system. Another important section of the report is the competitive analysis of the global CCTV Camera market. Deeper home security systems include surveillance cameras inside and in the garden, smoke detectors, water detectors and various audible alarms and floodlighting.</p>
