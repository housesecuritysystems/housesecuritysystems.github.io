<p>The global video surveillance market was valued at $42.94 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $144.85 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 14.6% from 2020 to 2027. A key-operated switch in the sounder circuit allows you to turn the alarm system completely off when it is not needed.

<p>However, if entry to the vehicle is authorized and the engine is started within the 15 second or 30 second time interval as selected by switch 88, then charge comparator 42 is switched to provide a positive logic output, which resets arming timer 50 and flip-flop 72. If the output of flip-flop 72 drops to a zero logic level before timeout of entry delay timer 86, then no output pulse is provided by timer 86 and no alarm is sounded.</p>
