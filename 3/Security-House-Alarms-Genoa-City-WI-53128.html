<p>In accordance with the invention, a burglar alarm of an automotive vehicle having an electrical system including a battery, battery cables, at least one electrical device for drawing current from the battery, a switch for controlling current flow from the battery to the device and the charging means for supplying charging current to the battery, comprises a direct current coupled input means for providing a voltage directly proportional to the amount of current interchanged between the battery and the electrical system of the automobile; an arming means responsive to the voltage for arming said burglar alarm only when less than a first predetermined current is interchanged between the battery and the electrical system; and an alarm means for producing an alarm when the alarm is armed and more than a second predetermined amount of current is drawn from said battery.</p>

From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41. Whenever any one not' knowing the nature of the premises passes between the bulb 92 and cell 94, the rays are cut 0H as before; and the alarm system is set into operation.</p>
