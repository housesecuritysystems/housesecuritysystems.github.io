Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do. While there is no camera that can perfectly mimic the dynamic range and depth of vision of the human eye, advances in technology provide solutions for dynamic range, 360 degree vision and the handling of different lighting conditions.</p>

<p>Outdoor security cameras are generally more expensive than their indoor counterparts. With the DIY security system, you can change modes automatically as you come and go, receive alerts if a window or door is left open and much more. Whenever anyone tries to interrupt the transmitted laser beam falling on the receiver, the buzzer alarms as an indication to catch the burglars.</p>

Understand resolution: The higher the resolution number, the sharper the image will be. Entry level camera resolution is 330 lines, high resolution cameras producing better than 400 lines.
