<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
<p>Compared to equipment offered by other home security providers, Protect America's may not be the most impressive, but their door and windows sensors, indoor and outdoor cameras and glass-break detectors are all sturdy and functional. Smart city projects have created a huge demand for the surveillance market. Included in the package are 3 long-lasting, fast-charging rechargeable lithium ion batteries that will take the cost out of uninterrupted monitoring, since you can easily swap them out and power up in seconds without having your cameras offline.</p>
