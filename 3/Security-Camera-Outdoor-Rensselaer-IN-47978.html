Software is used on the local PC that allows access to the digital video recorder. More high-end equipment packages—like the ones Vivint Smart Home provides—come with a touch-screen control panel and the option to add outdoor home security cameras, all of which require professional installation.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system.

Every city has a few security companies that are known for providing professional services.</p>
