<p>IP surveillance cameras offer various benefits over analog surveillance such as real-time surveillance, remote accessibility, digital zooming capability, lower operational & infrastructure cost, greater integration potential, ease of data distribution, easy installation, and adjustable frame rates which boost the growth of the video surveillance market globally.</p>

There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
