<p>Equipment's not the only thing that Ring Alarm sells on the cheap; it's also professional monitoring. Security cameras can be very helpful in alerting you to an event or showing you what happened after the fact.

To be effective, however, your home security must be visible to potential criminals, such as security cameras, the use of stickers and signs, and the strategic use of lighting.
