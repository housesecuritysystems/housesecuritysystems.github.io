<p>Suggestions include rotating personnel every 2 h, limit TV monitors to fewer than 10, arrange monitors in a curved configuration in front of the viewer, control the lighting over the console to avoid glare on the monitor screens or tilt the monitors if necessary, place the monitors in an order that permits easy recognition of camera locations, provide a swivel chair that hampers the opportunity for sleeping, and assign tasks to the viewer (e.g., communications and logging).</p>

Appointing security guards is a traditional practice, but with developing technology, a number of surveillance aids are made available.
