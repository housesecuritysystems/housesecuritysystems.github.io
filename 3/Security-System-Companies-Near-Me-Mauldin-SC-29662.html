<h3>5 Reasons To Install a Video Security Camera System At Your Home in Mauldin</h3>
<p>Equipped with superb imaging ability and backed by 50x zoom ratio and the patented DarkFighterX technology, as well as intelligent functions like smart tracking and false alarm filtering, Ultra Series cameras provide comprehensive assistance to customers. These are some of the few factors that are further adding to the impressive growth rate of the Indian surveillance industry, paving the way for it to nearly triple its current market size to reach $2.4 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of systems which use current loop detection is that arming may occur even though current is being drawn from the battery due to, for example, a door being open or a radio being on. Since only changes in current (and not steady state current conditions) are monitored, it is not possible for such systems to differentiate between a steady state current and zero current condition.</p>
