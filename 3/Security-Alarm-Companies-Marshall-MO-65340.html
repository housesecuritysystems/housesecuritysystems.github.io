<p>Surveillance plays a huge part in today's society, and with cameras all around us, our day-to-day lives are experiencing higher levels of security each day.

They'll also send an alert to your phone when someone or something is out there, record video of the event, and depending on features, let you talk to whoever is on your property, all without ever having to open your door (or even be inside your house, for that matter).</p>
<p>Software, appliances, servers, and cameras, all from one source. You'll have to pay a monthly fee for professional monitoring, but self-monitoring is usually free.
