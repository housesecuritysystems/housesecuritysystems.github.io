<p>The remote control is one of the features of this home security system so that you can arm and disarm the alarms with the keychain or the app. Keep in mind though, Vivint is not a DIY system — it does require professional installation.

<p>Before you choose a video surveillance camera, make sure you know exactly what you need to survey. Cons: Some security systems may cost you every month for maintenance (while some are not), and you may need to secure your home security cameras for better safety consideration.
