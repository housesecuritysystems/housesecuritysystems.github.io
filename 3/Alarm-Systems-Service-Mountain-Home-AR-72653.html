<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft.

In 2015 RPA teamed up with Shawn Soeder, one of our Passive House clients, an engineer by training who has experience in information technology, to create the specifications and installation instructions for an Arduino -based Passive House IoT Climate Monitoring and Reporting System.</p>
<p>Equipment's not the only thing that Ring Alarm sells on the cheap; it's also professional monitoring. Security cameras can be very helpful in alerting you to an event or showing you what happened after the fact. There is a single (or sometimes two) sensors inside looking for changes in infrared energy. At larger airports, this means the purchase, installation, and integration of hundreds or thousands of CCTV cameras.</p>

<p>Whether you need a system to protect your home or business, you can depend on surveillance video systems to document everything that happens on your property.

Proxim's wireless solutions have enabled highly reliable video surveillance networks in all corners of the globe.</p>
<p>An analogue or digital camera connected to a video server acts as a network camera, but the image size is restricted to that of the video standard of the camera.

<p>Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered.
