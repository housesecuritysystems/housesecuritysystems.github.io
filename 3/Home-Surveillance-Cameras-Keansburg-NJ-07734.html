Whether you go with DIY or pro monitoring, you'll be able to set up these options yourself, since most are wireless without the need for permanent installation. In 2019, the situation has changed: home security systems have grown both more technologically sophisticated and user friendly, increasing their accuracy and reducing the risk of false alarms.</p>
<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are relatively discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from deterring criminals. Melissa Ngo, EPIC, Chapter: You Are Being Watched But Not Protected: The Myth of Security Under Camera Surveillance, in the book "Intersection: Sidewalks & Public Space" (Chain 2008).</p>

<p>Along with fire safety measures (if the indoor temperature reaches 60 degrees or above, an alarm will sound and the lock will automatically release), it also provides extra anti-theft security (an alarm goes off if the door is unlocked from the inside when you're not at home) and an automatic locking function that means you'll never forget to lock the door again.</p>
