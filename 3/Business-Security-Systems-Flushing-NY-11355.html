Offers may not be combined with certain other promotional offers on the same services and may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. Most security systems require a monthly payment for monitoring and a one-time payment for the equipment. You do not want to have a long entry time as a burglar entering through a delay zone has the same amount of time in your protected area before the alarm goes off.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras. These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible.</p>
