<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
<p>Temperature monitors for spikes and dips in indoor temperature and alerts when it falls outside a range you define. These are the best indoor home security cameras in our testing.

His solution failed: It only worked on stationary cameras, and the student's video camera was moving when she filmed her family.</p>
<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
