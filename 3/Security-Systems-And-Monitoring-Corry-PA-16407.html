<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
<p>And they won't use your WiFi or slow it down unless you access the security cameras for remote viewing or the cameras send you alerts when motion is detected. With ADT home security packages, you get more than just a smart security system. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks. Bottom Line: Vivint is a high-end wireless system that offers same day professional installation.</p>
