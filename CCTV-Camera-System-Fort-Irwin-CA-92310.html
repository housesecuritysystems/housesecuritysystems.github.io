<p>Plus, Vivint works with third-party smart home devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Nest. Google's latest move also speaks of the growing competition by technology companies to own” the smart home, with an array of devices spanning cameras, voice-enabled smart speakers, displays, and more serving to hook consumers into distinct connected ecosystems.</p>
