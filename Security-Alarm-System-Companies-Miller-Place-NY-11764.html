<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions. The police would visit their house and install the WiFi modem and other camera equipment. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system.
