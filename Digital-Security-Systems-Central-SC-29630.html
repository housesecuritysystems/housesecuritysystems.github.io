The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
