GizmoSmart Home Security System is a Cloud based IP Surveillance Camera which helps secures your home and loved ones when you are away.</p>

And while Arlo doesn't have any additional security equipment available, they do have a full line of complementary accessories from which you can choose, as well as an available Baby Camera option.</p>
<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>Our wide range of affordable, high-quality CCTV products is sure to be the perfect addition to your company's security efforts. They offer an easy do-it-yourself security system with technologically-advanced equipment. But, the jewellery shops have been reluctant to keep burglar alarms connected to police stations.

The outdoor camera is waterproof, comes with night vision, has a 12x digital zoom to enhance any detail you need to focus on. Both can also be included in a Nest Aware package to record and store all video automatically to the cloud.</p>
