<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? They sell high-decibel alarm systems that are compatible with video cameras, environmental monitoring, home automation and voice control. Our security specialists can provide and install monitored, wireless, or remote alarm systems for houses and businesses across the South East region. Some small retailers selling unbranded cameras may only offer a statutory six month product guarantee at best, which you might find yourself fighting for, if the camera fails within that time frame.</p>
<p>Base stations are the center of a security system, using WiFi and wireless technology to connect all the various sensors, cameras, and other system components. Wired home security cameras send data through a closed circuit, not over a signal.

<p>Video surveillance software is used to manage data streamed from security cameras, as well as manage the devices. This is evidenced by recent statistics about burglaries and the fact that one occurs every 12 seconds in the US.
