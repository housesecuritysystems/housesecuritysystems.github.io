Digital cameras are becoming the industry standard for their resolution and the ability to store tons of data on hard drives, rather than videotapes. As you compare home security systems, it helps to understand the difference between wired or wireless systems and monitored or unmonitored alarms. Find a provider that offers an appropriate trial period to allow time for you to test out of your equipment.</p>
<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike.
