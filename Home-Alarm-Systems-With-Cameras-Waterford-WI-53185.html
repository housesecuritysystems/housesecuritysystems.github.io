An alert's processing time, or response time,” can depend on the system setup, monitoring center technology, staff training, and other factors. The system also integrates with smart home devices from other manufacturers, including Arlo home security cameras and the August Smart Lock Pro These can be installed at the same time as the system or added in later on.
