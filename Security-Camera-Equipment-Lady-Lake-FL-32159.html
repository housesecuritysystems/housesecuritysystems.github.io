<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras. These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible.</p>
<h2>Home Security Solutions Lady Lake Florida</h2>

Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems.</p>
<p>To further give you peace of mind, SimpliSafe offers a 60-day money-back guarantee, more than double the time you get with many other home security services. Nest Secure is a perfect home security system if you want a fully DIY security and smart home system. Spy cameras are miniature cameras which you can place discreetly to monitor specific areas. Consider using door and window contacts instead if you have a large dog or cat, as these might trip motion sensors.</p>
