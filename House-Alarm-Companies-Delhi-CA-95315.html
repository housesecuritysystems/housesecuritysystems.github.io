Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>
<p>You don't even have to sacrifice the camera's versatility and with its PTZ control, you can follow and record the action as it happens, when a motion alert has been triggered. Cameras and doorbells are also easy to install, but you'll have to pair them yourself.
