Closed-circuit TV (CCTV) cameras are mushrooming everywhere in India in public, private and commercial spaces. CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event.

The demand for security and surveillance equipment is on the rise across all verticals, given the increasing awareness among customers about security.</p>
<p>In Wireless Systems , the principle is the same except no wires are required to connect the sensor to the Control Unit. With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone. You can monitor these systems yourself using a mobile app, but many DIY companies also offer flexible, no-contract professional monitoring plans.</p>

<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security.
