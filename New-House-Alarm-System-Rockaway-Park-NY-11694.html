<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions. The police would visit their house and install the WiFi modem and other camera equipment. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter.</p>
<p>Whether you want to buy a security system and add on a video doorbell, or to build a safer, smarter home one device at a time, Ring is a solid option. To come up with our picks for the best home security systems, we looked at the latest systems companies offered. It's true that bringing an electrician to your house for the installation will increase the total cost of the equipment, but once installed, the devices allow for significant savings.</p>

<p>For low-end products, it starts from 300INR, the wireless indoor camera starts from 1200INR & a CCTV set up kit with 4 cameras will cost approx 15-20k INR.

CCTV cameras also have the potential of creating unintended effects, good and bad.</p>
