<p>If you get a Ring camera to go with your alarm system, you'll have to pay $3 each month or $30 a year for video recording. At the time of the introduction in the market, these cameras were extremely expensive. Since starting operation in 1986, we have provided monitoring services to more than 800,000 individual offenders. Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line.</p>
<p>Control Panel: The control panel is the computer that arms and disarms the security systems, communicates with each installed component, sounds the alarm when a security zone is breached, and communicates with an alarm monitoring company. Our door and window alarms help detect break-ins, and our optional glass break sensors are prepared for all situations; if intruders bypass the usual sensors by breaking the glass as opposed to picking the locks, the glass break sensors will sound an alarm.</p>
<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
