<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
<p>Home owners rely heavily on these systems to ensure their safety, and without the control panel monitoring everything happening within the home this is impossible.
