However, additional sensors and things such as cameras will increase the price, often significantly. Network cameras can be wireless and still work through a network and are used in big departmental stores, food chains, malls, factory, work shop, and many other public places to keep a check of the activities.</p>
<p>A monitored home security system can be wireless or wired, but it's rare to see home alarm companies offer an unmonitored, wired system. The results weren't exactly glowing, but we thought the monitoring center was responsive, the cameras offered crisp video, and the home automation â€” well, there really wasn't much in the automation department.

A key offering is SMART Connect, a free home security smartphone app developed by Protect America that allows remote control from anywhere, and is available for both Android and iOS.</p>
<p>From there, you can add cameras for another $110-$300 to see what's happening at home before calling the police or fire responders.
