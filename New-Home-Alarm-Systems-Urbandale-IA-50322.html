Many security companies outsource their monitoring to a 3rd party dispatch. Frontpoint offers five plans , all of which include professional monitoring for $35-$40 per month. To research the best security system for your needs, consider whether you require video monitoring, you want voice recognition features, and how technically savvy you are about managing your system.</p>

<p>Once it's installed, you'll get alerts whenever the camera's motion sensors goes off, and you can see who's at your door and talk to them through the camera mic. Some add Bluetooth for local control and easier setup through your smartphone, while others incorporate separate home automation networking standards to interact with other devices, like Zigbee or Z-Wave.</p>
<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
