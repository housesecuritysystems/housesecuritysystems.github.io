<p>Bosch offers a wide range of video security cameras, recording solutions and software to deliver intelligent solutions that deliver smart data that helps to improve safety, increase efficiency and reduce costs. These systems also allow you to control your smart security from your phone, even when you're away from home.

The video surveillance market is expected to leverage high potential for the commercial and infrastructure industry verticals in 2025.
