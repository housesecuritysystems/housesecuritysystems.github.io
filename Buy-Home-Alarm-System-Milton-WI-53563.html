<p>Alfred is free to use and gives you a remote view of your live feed, motion detection with alerts, free cloud storage, a two-way audio feed and use of both the front and rear cameras. There have long been well-established rules governing the audio recording of individuals without their consent (there is a reason surveillance cameras never have microphones).</p>
<p>Many home security companies offer monitoring services with free or discounted equipment as long as you have a monitoring contract. When a customer calls East Texas Alarm, they speak with an actual East Texas Alarm employee directly about their monitoring and service needs.

This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market.

Many home insurance providers offer discounts of up to 20% for those with monitored alarm systems.
