<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189). Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>
