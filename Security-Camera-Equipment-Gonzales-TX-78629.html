Although IP Cctv Cameras can be connected directly to an existing network, bandwidth is always a consideration as the data sent from the cctv camera is likely to be much larger than standard data transferred over usual office networks which if not planned correctly can slow down the entire network. A reputable security company will sell CCTV surveillance cameras with a warranty of up to three years and offer either a self-install option, or a professional installation service.</p>
<p>This is the best and worst scenario you can have, you have really good cameras, audio, and great day image, but the NVR will be dead if you don't follow instructions one by one, and night vision is really poor, so for this home surveillance system reviews are a little hard.
