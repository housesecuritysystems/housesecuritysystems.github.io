Today's best systems feature high-resolution cameras with motion detection, night vision, mobile access, cloud storage, and more.</p>
<p>Nest thoughtfully designs its equipment and packages too; it includes two key fobs with every security equipment package—that's normally an add-on. It's professionally installed, it will look good in your house, and it supports a ton of smart home devices. The Eufy Security app also offers the ability to set activity zones, so you can draw a box on the screen to specify the area you're interested in. This is vital if you have a camera that overlooks a busy road, for example.</p>
