A pair of input leads, each lead being for connection to one of two spaced apart points of an electrical current loop including said electrical device, said points being selected to produce a detectable voltage between said input leads when current is drawn from said battery by said electrical device.</p>
<p>Box cameras present an obvious sign for anyone who passes by that they are being recorded on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime. Furthermore, there are impressive integration features for many popular smart home devices, including Nest Thermostat, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home.
