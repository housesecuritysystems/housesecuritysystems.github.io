<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? They sell high-decibel alarm systems that are compatible with video cameras, environmental monitoring, home automation and voice control. Our security specialists can provide and install monitored, wireless, or remote alarm systems for houses and businesses across the South East region. Some small retailers selling unbranded cameras may only offer a statutory six month product guarantee at best, which you might find yourself fighting for, if the camera fails within that time frame.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>
