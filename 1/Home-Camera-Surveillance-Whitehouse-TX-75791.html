<p>If unauthorized entry to the engine compartment (or trunk) occurs, line 36 goes to a logic high level and sets flip-flop 74. The output of flip-flop 74 is directly connected to a second input of OR gate 90. This instantly activates sounding timer 92 and the alarm is sounded for two minutes until reset due to the action of one shot 94, as described above.</p>
<p>The output of discharge comparator 40 is connected to a first input of an OR gate 76. The output of OR gate 76 is connected to the set input of flip-flop 72. Thus, once the system is armed, any discharge of current which causes a sufficient drop across battery cable 24 to change the state of discharge comparator 40 produces an output which is supplied to the set input of flip-flop 72.</p>
