Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>

Wired home security cameras send data through a closed circuit, not over a signal.

<p>Whether you need a system to protect your home or business, you can depend on surveillance video systems to document everything that happens on your property.

This action coupled with an electric current (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to detect a fault on that zone or circuit.</p>
