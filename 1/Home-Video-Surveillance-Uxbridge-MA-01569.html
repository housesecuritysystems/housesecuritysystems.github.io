<p>On 17 August, Meity added 13 electronic items, including smart watches and CCTV cameras, to the Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirement for Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012, which means these will now have to meet standards as notified by the government and companies will not be allowed to import or sell any non-compliant product in the country.</p>
<p>Additional sensors can also be added at a fairly low cost, like a $70 smoke detector, additional motion detectors for $40 and a $120 camera that can be used indoors or outside. It's well worth investing time in researching home security systems in order to gain peace of mind knowing that you've chosen the right system to protect your home and family. Do I really need a home security system - while most people think of home security systems as a way to protect their homes from burglaries, what many people may not realize is that these systems can also protect homes from fires as well - a must, literally, to have a home security camera system.</p>
<p>Vivint's monthly monitoring service plans aren't too expensive, but its equipment costs a pretty penny. The company features some helpful installation videos on the Scout website, where you can also find additional recommendations and installation tips.
