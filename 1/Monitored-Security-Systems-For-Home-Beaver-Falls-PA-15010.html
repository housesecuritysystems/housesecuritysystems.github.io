<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors.
