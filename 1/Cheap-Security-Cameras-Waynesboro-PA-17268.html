Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do.

Cons: Some security systems may cost you every month for maintenance (while some are not), and you may need to secure your home security cameras for better safety consideration.
