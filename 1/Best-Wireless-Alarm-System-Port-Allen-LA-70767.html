<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Nowadays, with advanced technology, you have high-quality network IP cameras available at reasonable prices. When your alarm goes off, two indicators within the house, such as a door contact and a motion sensor, must both have been triggered to warrant police call-out.

<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>If you want to add extras like cameras or security lighting, the up-front equipment price gets a lot steeper—but there's no company that can beat Ring's $10 a month monitoring fee.
