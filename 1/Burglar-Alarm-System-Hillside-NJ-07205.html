<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Security lights are very useful to scare the intruders especially if these lights are employed in the compound or on the roof tops. You can choose from our Expert Approved security DVR recorder , and IP camera NVR , or Tribrid DVR that's perfect for you, as well as our many CCTV cameras and accessories to configure the perfect system for your needs. Once the specific balance of video data quantity, quality, and archiving required for a given security application is determined, it's easy to estimate the amount of storage capacity an NVR system must include.</p>
