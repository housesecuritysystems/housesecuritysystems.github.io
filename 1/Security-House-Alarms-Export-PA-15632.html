<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>Equipment's not the only thing that Ring Alarm sells on the cheap; it's also professional monitoring. Security cameras can be very helpful in alerting you to an event or showing you what happened after the fact. There is a single (or sometimes two) sensors inside looking for changes in infrared energy. At larger airports, this means the purchase, installation, and integration of hundreds or thousands of CCTV cameras.</p>

The control panel may then communicate with you or the security company by either a wired or wireless connection - often WiFi, Bluetooth or a cellular signal. CCTV cameras also have the potential of creating unintended effects, good and bad.</p>
