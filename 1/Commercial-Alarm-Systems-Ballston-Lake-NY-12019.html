<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. Although CCTV can be used in a wide variety of applications, its operation is affected by a number of performance factors: The performance of a surveillance system depends on a number of factors including the characteristics of the object to be observed (eg, its size, reflectance, and contrast); local environmental conditions (eg, atmospheric clarity and scene illumination); camera characteristics (eg, detector size, sensitivity, and resolution); characteristics of the camera objective lens (eg, focal length and relative aperture); characteristics of a display or monitor (eg, resolution and contrast); and the ability of the human eye to resolve target details (which also depends on whether this is done in daylight or at night) (TSA, 2006, p. 162).</p>
<p>Basic units are usually just a transmitter and receiver pair, whereas higher end units can have multiple cameras on a single receiver. The Ministry of Railways has also initiated installation of CCTV cameras in 983 railway stations and train coaches for which funding is partly using the Nirbhaya Fund, as per a Lok Sabha answer in June 2019. Both reviewers and customers praised the professional installation of the Vivint system and praised the way in which the installer will set up the smart home integration for you: No more fiddling with Alexa skills to get the two connected.</p>
