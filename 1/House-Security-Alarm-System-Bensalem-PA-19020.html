Quick action is important during break-ins, and burglar alarms facilitate fast response by alerting people in the vicinity to compromised security as soon as it occurs. The major drawback of IP cameras is their higher price tag. Government initiatives in various countries to install video surveillance cameras in public places such as cities, schools, colleges, religious places, airports, and stations further drive market growth.</p>
<p>The key players profiled in the video surveillance industry include HKVISION, Ltd., Bosch Security System, Honeywell Security Group, Dahua Technology, FLIR, Panasonic, Avigilon, Axis Communication, Infinova, and Pelco. For example, Simplisafe features high-quality DIY (no tools required!) security equipment with a wide variety of plans, plenty of add-on equipment options, and no contract requirements.</p>

<p>Home security centers also offer environmental monitoring. The ADT mobile app extends control of your system to your phone. Pricing for DIY security systems varies from company to company and will depend on the size of your home and the number of sensors and add-on components that you order.

<p>The Smart Home Video Monitoring plan adds intelligent assistance for complete home monitoring with smart video cameras. Mostly fixed cameras are used in video surveillance as they are five to eight times less costly than PTZ cameras. Within five years, industry watchers say, remote monitoring systems will be standard add-ons to your cable or phone service.

<p>To gauge reaction times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensors. Simply go to one of the video surveillance storage matrix tables to select the table row that lists the frame resolution and fps needed for each 24×7 video stream, then read across to find the nearest desired archival period (shown in days) and the corresponding drive capacity required for each individual stream.</p>
