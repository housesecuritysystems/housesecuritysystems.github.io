<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>Cost-effective network video recording servers. We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Kit because it includes all the basics (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a few extra entry sensors. The timer is connected with a set of components to switch the laser light at certain frequency. The Google Nest Secure alarm system is priced at $399 and includes basic equipment like Nest Guard, Nest Detect, a Nest Tag and the Nest App.</p>
