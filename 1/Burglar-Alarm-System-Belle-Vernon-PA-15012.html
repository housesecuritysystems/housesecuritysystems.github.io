A VIP system consists of a video camera (a digitiser in the case of analogue cameras) and a microprocessor for processing the digital-image - and software to interpret the image content and extract detection information from it.</p>
<p>As with all other DIY home security systems, Protect America delivers the equipment to your door and lets you handle the rest. If you get a burglar alarm maintenance contract, your alarm will be checked once a year (twice a year if you have a police-monitoring contract) either remotely or by an installer coming to your home.

<p>Environments with more stringent security requirements (for example, schools, public buildings, and airports) rely on 24×7 video streams with higher resolution, and more frames per second to better identify suspicious persons and activity. Security systems have recently adopted cellular technology, making them easier than ever to install without professional help.</p>
<p>If you lease rather than own the security equipment, then a long-term monitoring agreement could have the lowest rates. Many also offer support for IFTTT (If This Then That) applets, which use triggers from IFTTT-compatible web services and devices to create an action. Another reason why you should need home security camera systems is that they can help your home to be smart.</p>
