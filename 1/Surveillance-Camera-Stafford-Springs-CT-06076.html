As for iPhones and other iOS devices, Apple's built-in security makes life tough both for malware coders and antivirus writers.</p>
<p>Driven by video analytics, CCTV cameras are able to zoom in to reveal the identity of an individual - intruder and guest - that is highly beneficial to prevent crimes when utilized properly. If you want to remotely record a security camera, you can try to set up the recording to an FTP server.
