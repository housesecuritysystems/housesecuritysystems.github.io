Several cameras can be interconnected to a single monitor located in a security room. That way, you don't have to open five or six different apps to use your cool smart home tech with your security system. The peace of mind knowing someone is monitoring your smart cameras, smart lights and smart speakers, is priceless.</p>

Presently, 65 cameras could cover 20 to 25 houses at the same time and number of cameras will be decided based on the size of the house.

<p>The Mi Home Security Camera Basic 1080p does not store any data on the cloud (unlike Yi, which gives you a 30-day free cloud storage for your video feeds and you can opt for different plans to get more storage) Having a cloud storage is a better option as you are assured that your video feeds are not corrupted in the micro SD card or not lost if the camera itself is stolen or damaged.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the increasing penetration of home security systems, the DIY systems become an attractive alternative for newer customers with average disposable incomes. Though some burglar alarms are successfully triggered by the unexpected motion caused by break-ins, studies have shown that an audible alarm may not always have the intended effect. In general, the customer reviews regarding the quality of service are positive, which can sometimes be hard to find in the home security business.</p>
<p>Thanks to years of experience and expertise in structural design and 316L stainless steel material, Hikvision's Explosion-Proof Series Cameras have passed rigorous test and are certified by ATEX and IECEx. There are, however, some CCTV cameras that are battery operated. CCTV cameras can be attached to your home or business network to sound the alarm of a security breach and transmit data such as images to a security providers' control centre via a broadband connection, such as wireless, GSM or ADSL.</p>
