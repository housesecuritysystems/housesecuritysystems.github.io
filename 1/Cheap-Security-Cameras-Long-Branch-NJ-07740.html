In order to detect such entry, these alarm systems require that each point of entry (hood, trunk door) have associated therewith a switch (including in some cases a light activated by the switch) which would cause current to be drawn from the battery when the point of entry was accessed.</p>

With rolling code technology minimizing any chance of a security breach, this is a strong indoor motion sensor helping you save money and detect any intruders in one hit.</p>
