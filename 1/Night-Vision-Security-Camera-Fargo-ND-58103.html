<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. IP camera: An Internet Protocol camera generally transmits a digital signal using Internet Protocol over a network. Home security system installation costs depend on your method of installation — professional installation costs $100 to $500 or more, while DIY security systems are free to install yourself. The video surveillance market is highly competitive, owing to strong presence of the existing vendors.</p>
<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft.

Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now. Set up your system to send you alerts and notifications on your mobile device when cameras detect motion or a door opens, so you know what's happening at home.</p>

<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Basic units are usually just a transmitter and receiver pair, whereas higher end units can have multiple cameras on a single receiver. The Ministry of Railways has also initiated installation of CCTV cameras in 983 railway stations and train coaches for which funding is partly using the Nirbhaya Fund, as per a Lok Sabha answer in June 2019.
