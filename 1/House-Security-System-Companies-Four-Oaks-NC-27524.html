<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats.
