<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Cable 24 serves as a shunt resistor in the sense that whenever current is drawn from or charged to the battery, a voltage is created across cable 24. It is this voltage drop which provides the basic input signal to the circuitry illustrated in FIG. Be it IP cameras, megapixel cameras, HD-CCTV, video management systems (VMS), DVRs, compression, systems integration, monitors, fiber, analytics, WiFi or mesh networks, you'll find it here.</p>
