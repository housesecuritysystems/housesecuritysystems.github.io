<p>Traditional home security devices like burglar alarms, glass break detectors, and outdoor cameras are helpful if you're worried about issues like intrusion, theft, or vandalism. With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks , you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors. If you require more than a week's worth of video storage, you can subscribe to a 30-day plan and not have to worry about losing important footage before you've had a chance to review it and download it.</p>
<p>Also mobile devices like tablets, smartphones and body-worn cameras can be connected safely to your video security system. A few cameras will even let you save video to a portable USB or NAS drive, but these devices are few and far between. Big Data systems provide the means for creating and implementing video surveillance architectures that scale in a seamless and cost-effective way.</p>
