With standard smart home devices like automatic door locks , you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors.

<p>Also mobile devices like tablets, smartphones and body-worn cameras can be connected safely to your video security system. A few cameras will even let you save video to a portable USB or NAS drive, but these devices are few and far between. Big Data systems provide the means for creating and implementing video surveillance architectures that scale in a seamless and cost-effective way.</p>
