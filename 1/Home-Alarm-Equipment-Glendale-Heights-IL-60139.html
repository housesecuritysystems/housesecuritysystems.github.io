<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The EufyCam 2C is an impressive wireless home security camera system that offers a great range of features for a very affordable price. Also, Argus 2 and the other Reolink battery-powered security cameras won't work with any third-party storage options. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common.</p>
<p>Some systems store recorded video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others offer cloud storage. Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras only from certain manufacturers and not others. To maintain its leadership position in the video surveillance market, the company is focusing on investing in products and solutions related to the security business.</p>
