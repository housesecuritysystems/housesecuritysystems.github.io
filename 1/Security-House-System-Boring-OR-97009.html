<p>The camera also has a night vision feature but just like daytime video recording, footages taken at night look a little underpowered. Pair your sensors with the Ooma Home Security app, and select your notification settings.

<p>We usually think of surveillance cameras as digital eyes, watching over us or watching out for us, depending on your view. Video doorbells are also an option for DIY systems.

Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
