Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do. While there is no camera that can perfectly mimic the dynamic range and depth of vision of the human eye, advances in technology provide solutions for dynamic range, 360 degree vision and the handling of different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>And they won't use your WiFi or slow it down unless you access the security cameras for remote viewing or the cameras send you alerts when motion is detected. With ADT home security packages, you get more than just a smart security system. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks.

<p>The Washington Post reported in February 2014 that new aerial video surveillance technologies are being deployed that can monitor virtually everything in an area the size of a small city.

<p>If you have a large home or property that needs comprehensive coverage, wired systems are a better option because they can support more cameras.

With rolling code technology minimizing any chance of a security breach, this is a strong indoor motion sensor helping you save money and detect any intruders in one hit.</p>
<p>A high-decibel alarm is sounded and in most instances the alarm monitoring company is automatically notified. These devices will record video when the doorbell ringer is pressed or when motion is detected, and in most cases can be programmed to trigger other system devices such as door locks and interior cameras. Though unmonitored systems are often smartphone compatible, you'll be tasked with monitoring them yourself.</p>
