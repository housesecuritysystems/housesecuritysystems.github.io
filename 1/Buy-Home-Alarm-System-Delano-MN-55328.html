<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. Security cameras give you the extra benefit of just staying in the know about what is going on in and around your business. The pan 3 receives a suitable charge of explosive illuminating powder and when this powder is ignited the whole scene'within ran e of the camera 2 is strongly lighted to ena le a picture of the place including the criminals committing the theft or robbery to be taken; and at the same time the alarm 6 is actuated to summon assistance.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on.
