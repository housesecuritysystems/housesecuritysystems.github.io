<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors. Today, the most pop recorders include an NVR (Network Video Recorder), a DVR (Digital Video Recorder), a computer (the hard drive on the computer actually), a Micro SD card, the FTP server, and Cloud.</p>
<p>Before you choose a video surveillance camera, make sure you know exactly what you need to survey. Cons: Some security systems may cost you every month for maintenance (while some are not), and you may need to secure your home security cameras for better safety consideration.

<p>Installing such cameras is easy as they require standard installing equipment such as C-clamps or S-clamps. The scopes like prevention, detection, and intervention which have led to the development of real and consistent video surveillance systems are capable of intelligent video processing competencies. With so many security applications entailing dozens of cameras and 24×7 video streams, it soon becomes apparent that a typical NVR system's storage requirements can easily reach beyond 10 TB. In the following three examples, the varying video profiles of different security environments (and the storage capacities they require) are compared.</p>
<p>You may need security cameras for personal use, for your home or office. The advent of 360o cameras equipped with video de-warping technology is eliminating the need to deploy 3 to 4 PTZ (or the standard CCTV) cameras to cover a single region, as a single device can now effectively do the same. But Nest Aware is now a far more appealing proposition for those looking to kit their homes out with multiple security cameras.</p>
<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
