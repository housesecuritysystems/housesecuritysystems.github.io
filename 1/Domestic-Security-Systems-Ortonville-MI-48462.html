<p>The best in smart home security systems. 4 Megapixel IP Cameras were Installed in the Locations and All the Locations were transmitted wirelessly to the Control Room. Color cameras are preferred during day time and in highly illuminated areas. The most effective home security systems combine quality equipment with best practices. Professionally installed systems take the trouble out of things for homeowners who don't have the time or expertise to set up all the sensors and accessories themselves.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>
