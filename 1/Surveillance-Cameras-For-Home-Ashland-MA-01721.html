<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>

Typically, a CCTV security system with 4 dome cameras, 4 channel DVR with 1 TB hard disk costs around 15k to 20k depending on factors like where are you living, CCTV and the length of wire.

<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions. The police would visit their house and install the WiFi modem and other camera equipment. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter.</p>
<p>Another great feature of the Ring Alarm is compatibility with other security devices you might have in your home.
