NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>Driven by video analytics, CCTV cameras are able to zoom in to reveal the identity of an individual - intruder and guest - that is highly beneficial to prevent crimes when utilized properly.
