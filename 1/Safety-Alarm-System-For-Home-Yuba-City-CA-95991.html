However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm—if they respond at all.</p>
<p>Start with detailed description of your security and business requirements and a reliable technology partner that will integrate and deploy the system on your behalf and the sky is the limit. The control panel may then communicate with you or the security company by either a wired or wireless connection - often WiFi, Bluetooth or a cellular signal.
