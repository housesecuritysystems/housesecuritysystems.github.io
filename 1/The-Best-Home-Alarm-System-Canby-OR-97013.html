<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>

<p>This invention relates to burglar alarms for automotive vehicles. Companies like abode and Arlo sell systems that begin recording footage as soon as motion detectors in your home are tripped, sending the video feed or a text alert to your phone while you're out.

It comes with a dedicated mobile app on Android and iOS which you can use to control the cameras.</p>

<p>Most home security systems involve DIY installation of surveillance equipment, so I make sure that that's an easy process. Whether you want to monitor a jewellery store, an office building or an industrial property - every building and outdoor area can be protected with an LST burglar and hold up alarm system. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>

Unlike conventional cameras that can only serve the monitoring purpose, a PIR camera, by virtue of the built-in PIR sensor, detects passive infrared radiation emitted from heat sources.</p>
<p>Digital Video Recorder (DVR) is used for video monitoring and storage of the recorded videos, and be a part of feature-rich security system.
