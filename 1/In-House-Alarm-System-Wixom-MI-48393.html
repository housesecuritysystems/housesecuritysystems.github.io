<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Our selection of DIY home security equipment, Fingerprint Door Locks and surveillance cameras is second to none, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. After you download and install the Ooma Smart Security mobile app to your iOS (Apple) or Android device and pair one or more of the wireless sensors, you can install the products throughout your home and get peace of mind knowing that you will receive alerts whenever unexpected activity occurs.</p>
