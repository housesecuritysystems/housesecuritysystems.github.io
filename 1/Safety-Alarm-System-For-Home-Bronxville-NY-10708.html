<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems.

<p>Box cameras present an obvious sign for anyone who passes by that they are being recorded on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime. Furthermore, there are impressive integration features for many popular smart home devices, including Nest Thermostat, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home.

<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
