On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>Each system was evaluated across several factors including cost, response time, installation complexity, features, quality of customer service, style, ease of use and more. The camera quality is good for all 4 cameras and recording is running well. It was further stated that private entities installed CCTV cameras voluntarily or on the directions of police.</p>

Microphonic systems vary in design (for example, time-domain reflectrometry or piezo-electric ) but each is generally based on the detection of an intruder attempting to cut or climb over a fence.
