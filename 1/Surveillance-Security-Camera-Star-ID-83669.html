<p>The best in smart home security systems. The Iota kit comes with a fun three-in-one Iota hub: security hub, motion detector, and camera, all rolled into a single device. Video analytics enhances video surveillance systems by performing the tasks of real-time event detection, post-event analysis, and extraction of statistical data while saving manpower costs and increasing the effectiveness of the surveillance system operation.</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring. We have been insisting on installing CCTV cameras in all shops, which has been adhered to. But, in case of burglar alarms, it becomes a nuisance if it is triggered by insects or rats. However, the professional installation of burglar alarm systems in the course of building construction or alteration is normally zero-rated.</p>

The wireless plug-and-play device combined with a remote controller comes equipped with door sensors that can detect intrusion from the door or window.

<p>Also mobile devices like tablets, smartphones and body-worn cameras can be connected safely to your video security system. A few cameras will even let you save video to a portable USB or NAS drive, but these devices are few and far between.

<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
