<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Quick action is important during break-ins, and burglar alarms facilitate fast response by alerting people in the vicinity to compromised security as soon as it occurs. The major drawback of IP cameras is their higher price tag. Government initiatives in various countries to install video surveillance cameras in public places such as cities, schools, colleges, religious places, airports, and stations further drive market growth.</p>
<p>Modern technology has made it possible to access the videos from these CCTV security systems live on phones. AxxonSoft's intelligent VMS software powered by Huawei's outstanding computing solutions maximizes public and business security. If something triggers your alarm, you can check your cameras to see what set it off.

<p>While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by authoritarian governments against political dissidents In these cases, the person under house arrest often does not have access to any means of communication with people outside of the home; if electronic communication is allowed, conversations may be monitored.</p>
