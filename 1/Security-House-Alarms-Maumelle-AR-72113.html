<p>If you want a video surveillance system without a home security system, we've got lots of recommendations in our best home security camera systems post. The standard Alarm Security Kit is priced at just $199 - cheaper than most competitors - yet comes with a base station, keypad, contact sensor, motion detector and range extender. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
<p>Nearly all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send push and email notifications when those sensors are triggered. It is also possible to defeat the system by introducing an auxiliary light source near the receiver and thus make it possible for an intruder to pass through the protective beam without causing an alarm.</p>

Appointing security guards is a traditional practice, but with developing technology, a number of surveillance aids are made available.
