<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. Nest security partners with Brinks, an award-winning alarm service, to provide professional emergency monitoring. After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app ‘EZVIZ' by the house owners. Electronic surveillance of employees also ensures your floor manager get more time to work on the critical aspects of their work rather than focusing their entire attention on monitoring people.</p>
<p>Compared to equipment offered by other home security providers, Protect America's may not be the most impressive, but their door and windows sensors, indoor and outdoor cameras and glass-break detectors are all sturdy and functional. Smart city projects have created a huge demand for the surveillance market.

<p>Important thing to note here is that in Window Sensor, current is always passing until there is a breakage in glass of a window.
