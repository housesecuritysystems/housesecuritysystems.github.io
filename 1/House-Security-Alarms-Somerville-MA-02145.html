<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Nowadays, with advanced technology, you have high-quality network IP cameras available at reasonable prices. When your alarm goes off, two indicators within the house, such as a door contact and a motion sensor, must both have been triggered to warrant police call-out. Matrix brings you centralized security with IP Video Surveillance solutions that can manage multiple devices located at multiple locations.</p>
<p>And they won't use your WiFi or slow it down unless you access the security cameras for remote viewing or the cameras send you alerts when motion is detected. With ADT home security packages, you get more than just a smart security system. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks.

Additionally, many home security companies charge high cancellation fees if you terminate a monitoring agreement before you pay for your equipment in full. Video surveillance is an important application that utilizes shared storage resources. Often, local municipalities require home security alarm permits These permits are said to help reduce the number of false alarms so that emergency services aren't unnecessarily taxed.</p>

<p>For controlling and output for monitoring. When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>
<p>If you want a video surveillance system without a home security system, we've got lots of recommendations in our best home security camera systems post. The standard Alarm Security Kit is priced at just $199 - cheaper than most competitors - yet comes with a base station, keypad, contact sensor, motion detector and range extender. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
<p>These wall-mounted devices now come with modern touchscreens, allowing you to control your home security and automation with the simple swipe of a finger. Run the software that came with your camera to set a password for the camera, and to see the IP address your router has assigned it. Type this IP address into your web browser address bar, and log in to your camera settings to get it running on your WiFi network.</p>
