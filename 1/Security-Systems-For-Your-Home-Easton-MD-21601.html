<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do. While there is no camera that can perfectly mimic the dynamic range and depth of vision of the human eye, advances in technology provide solutions for dynamic range, 360 degree vision and the handling of different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. IP cameras generally have a larger field of vision than analog cameras. Also refer to our Surveillance Storage Calculator that takes into account additional variables like video quality, compression type, and number of operational hours per day.</p>

A digital video surveillance system is a surveillance system that captures images and videos, which can be compressed, stored, or sent over communication networks.</p>
