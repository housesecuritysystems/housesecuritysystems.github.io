<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger. The Control Panel is integrated with a touchpad or touchscreen, where the alarm can be armed and disarmed. Today's technology permits the viewing of video images on personal digital assistants and cell phones.</p>
