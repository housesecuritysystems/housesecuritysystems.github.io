<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger. The Control Panel is integrated with a touchpad or touchscreen, where the alarm can be armed and disarmed. Today's technology permits the viewing of video images on personal digital assistants and cell phones.</p>
<p>We'll show you how a video surveillance system can help your business reduce loss, document events, improve employee safety, and gain visibility into your operations. They have indoor, outdoor, and doorbell camera options and advanced smart home capabilities.

In most cases, customers can also check the app to view live footage from security cameras. When the circuit is broken, the Control Panel will either sound an audible alarm or alert the security company - in some cases, both.</p>
<p>However, Growing government and stakeholder funding for developing smart cities and employing city surveillance solutions, rising demand for VSaaS services, ongoing technological advancements in Big Data, IoT, and cloud-based services, and rising trends of artificial intelligence and deep learning for video surveillance systems will provide opportunities to players in the video surveillance market during the forecast period.</p>
