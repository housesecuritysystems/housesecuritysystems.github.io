Manufacturers promote the use of spy cameras for various applications with the advent of AI, BIG data analytics, cloud computing, and face recognition options. However, factors such as high investment cost and lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras, hamper the market growth.</p>

On one account , about 50 years ago, the United Kingdom had somewhere north of 60 permanent CCTV cameras installed nationwide.
