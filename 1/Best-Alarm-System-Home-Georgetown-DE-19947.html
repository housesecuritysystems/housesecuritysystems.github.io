<p>Burglar alarms have become standard equipment in stores and other businesses, and they're becoming increasingly common in private homes as well. That's especially true if you've already sunk money into other Nest gear like the thermostat or cameras Instead of getting a separate security system, you can get one that syncs with your current equipment and uses the same app you're already used to. The typical applications of these smart cameras are Machine vision or intelligent video surveillance systems (IVSS).</p>
<p>ADT Blue is a camera-heavy, DIY version of the ADT system, and we like its cameras much better than the traditional” ADT versions.

<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>Most movable cameras allow the person monitoring it to move the camera from right to left (pan), up and down (tilt), and from a tight angle to a wide angle (close up zoom).

Most security systems require a monthly payment for monitoring and a one-time payment for the equipment. You do not want to have a long entry time as a burglar entering through a delay zone has the same amount of time in your protected area before the alarm goes off.</p>
<p>Nest Secure offers loads of smart gadgetry — so much so that you might get overwhelmed by all of the options. It doesn't receive publicly broadcasted content—only footage from security cameras installed on the premises. M. Priyamvadha, associate professor, Department of Criminology, University of Madras, also vouches for CCTV cameras as a crime deterrent. Amazon India features a wide variety of security cameras.</p>
