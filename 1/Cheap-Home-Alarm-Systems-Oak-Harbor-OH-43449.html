<p>But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and may even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact ( see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>If you have a large home or property that needs comprehensive coverage, wired systems are a better option because they can support more cameras. You'll also want the option to self-monitor your system using a mobile app for smartphone controls. However, larger systems involving multiple sensors will invariably have a separate control unit. When comparing prices for home security, include any expenses for equipment, installation, activation and monitoring.</p>
