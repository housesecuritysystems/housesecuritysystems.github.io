The outdoor camera is waterproof, comes with night vision, has a 12x digital zoom to enhance any detail you need to focus on. Both can also be included in a Nest Aware package to record and store all video automatically to the cloud.</p>

Some other requirements for alarm systems include where it cannot be located. Here again, however, this approach is not practical for long-term monitoring.
