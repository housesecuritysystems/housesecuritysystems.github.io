<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>
<p>Where movable cctv cameras are used a zoom lens is usually fitted to allow varying points of a monitored area to be viewed. Appropriate help is summoned when the alarm is activated, whether you are home or not, even when the security system is not armed. It will alert you on your smartphone and email if there is an unnatural motion in the periphery of the camera.</p>

<p>There are also rising concerns over people's privacy that is interrupted by excessive use of CCTV cameras worldwide. A more affordable alternative to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include many of the same features as their monitored counterpart, including sensors, alarms, and cameras, but they are not observed by a security service, meaning homeowners will not be paying the costly monthly expenses associated with monitored security systems.</p>
