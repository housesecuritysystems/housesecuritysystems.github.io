<p>The majority of CCTV cameras in use today are usually for surveillance and security purposes. For more sophisticated systems an analogue sensor can be used to detect the movement of a burglar by detecting changes in position, light, sound, pressure, or infrared. Also, because many security systems offer month-to-month contracts, you won't have to worry about being locked into something long-term or passing a contract on to the next renter.</p>
<p>The high definition IP Camera with Wide Angle access and Multiview feature never lets you miss any corner. Our burglar alarms may be armed in the Away” or Stay” mode. If there is no internet, the camera stores the video feed on the camera's micro SD card where you can access it from your smartphone and view it at your convenience. Right now Nest Secure has a few gaps in its security features (like an alarm that automatically delays by 30 seconds), but it's still worth considering—especially if all you need is basic home security that you can monitor yourself.</p>

Popular among the DIY crowd, wireless systems offer simple setup so you're up and running in a matter of minutes.
