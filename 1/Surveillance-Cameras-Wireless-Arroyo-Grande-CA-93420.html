<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions. The police would visit their house and install the WiFi modem and other camera equipment. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter.</p>

<p>ADT Smart Home is the security solution for modern living. He gives you time to sound your burglar-alarm and to get a pistol from under your pillow. When your home is professionally monitored, it means that monitoring specialists are standing by ready to dispatch emergency services in the event an alarm is triggered. Some energy monitors are used to monitor a single appliance at a time and give you a more detailed look at that particular device.</p>
<p>When Genetec first introduced the ability to encrypt video data in transit and at rest in 2016, the physical security industry saw it as an important innovation for protecting confidentiality in physical security systems.
