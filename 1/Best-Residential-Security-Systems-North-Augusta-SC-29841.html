<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. In any case, a remote monitoring center should arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unnecessary. In 2015 RPA teamed up with Shawn Soeder, one of our Passive House clients, an engineer by training who has experience in information technology, to create the specifications and installation instructions for an Arduino -based Passive House IoT Climate Monitoring and Reporting System.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>

You'll also want the option to self-monitor your system using a mobile app for smartphone controls. However, larger systems involving multiple sensors will invariably have a separate control unit. When comparing prices for home security, include any expenses for equipment, installation, activation and monitoring.</p>

Weather-ready wired networks let you scatter a combination of dome, turret or bullet cameras around your home-or even multiple properties-to ensure total coverage. Adding an exterior video camera gives you even more control over your home's security.</p>
