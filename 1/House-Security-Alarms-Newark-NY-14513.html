<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. In any case, a remote monitoring center should arrange an oral code to be provided by an authorized person in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unnecessary. In 2015 RPA teamed up with Shawn Soeder, one of our Passive House clients, an engineer by training who has experience in information technology, to create the specifications and installation instructions for an Arduino -based Passive House IoT Climate Monitoring and Reporting System.</p>
<p>Another great feature of the Ring Alarm is compatibility with other security devices you might have in your home. To research the best security system for your needs, decide if you want video monitoring, whether you want voice recognition features, and how technologically savvy you are in terms of how easy the system will be to use on a day-to-day basis. With our CCTV cameras, emergency response becomes immediate.</p>

The system also integrates with smart home devices from other manufacturers, including Arlo home security cameras and the August Smart Lock Pro These can be installed at the same time as the system or added in later on. That's a nice change from systems like Vivint Smart Home, which only works with its own components.</p>
