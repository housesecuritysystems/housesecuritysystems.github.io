<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a significant danger.

Today's technology permits the viewing of video images on personal digital assistants and cell phones.</p>
<p>Equipment's not the only thing that Ring Alarm sells on the cheap; it's also professional monitoring.
