<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>Beyond the specification of a proper edge computing architecture, video surveillance systems deployers have to deal with other challenges as well. The positive terminal 12 of battery 10 is connected through an appropriate cable 14 which connects the battery 10 to the alternator 18 and to other electrical loads represented by block 20. These loads include the engine ignition system, accessories, lights, etc.</p>
