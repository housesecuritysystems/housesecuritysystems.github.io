Nest security partners with Brinks, an award-winning alarm service, to provide professional emergency monitoring. After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app â€˜EZVIZ' by the house owners.

<p>If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras should be able to provide you with the necessary information. Videos from both IP cameras and analog cameras can be transferred over the computer network whereas unlike analog cameras, IP cameras can connect directly to an IP network.
