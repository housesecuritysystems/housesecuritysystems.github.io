<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. Companies can add detectors and sensors for fire, smoke, flood, carbon monoxide and even freezing pipes onto your monthly monitoring service for increased protection. The Ultra Series Fingerprint Terminals provide the large fingerprints and cards capacities and comprehensive access control functions for large projects. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides up to 48 sensors in its basic package, including both fire and CO alarms.</p>
<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>
