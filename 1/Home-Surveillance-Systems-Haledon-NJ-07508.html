<p>The best in smart home security systems. 4 Megapixel IP Cameras were Installed in the Locations and All the Locations were transmitted wirelessly to the Control Room. Color cameras are preferred during day time and in highly illuminated areas. The most effective home security systems combine quality equipment with best practices.
