<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Our integrated systems put the right cameras in the right places, smart DVRs and NVRs to record and manage your video operations. Rising number of smart homes propelling growth for DIY cameras. You can opt to automatically forward these Smart Alerts to ADT to increase monitoring coverage of your home.

Wireless cameras that you can attach to your wall can do all the dirty work, but if you have a bigger area to cover up you maybe want another type.</p>
<p>If IC Realtime represents the generic end of the market, Boulder shows what a boutique contractor can do. In both cases, though, what these firms are currently offering is just the tip of the iceberg. Growing concern about public safety is prompting wider deployment of video surveillance by government agencies, private organizations, and consumers. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%).</p>
