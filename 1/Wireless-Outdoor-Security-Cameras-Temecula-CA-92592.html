<p>SimpliSafe could be considered a disrupter in the home security industry, because it was among the first to provide forward-thinking customer benefits like self-installation, self-monitoring, video verification and month-to-month pricing. A key offering is SMART Connect, a free home security smartphone app developed by Protect America that allows remote control from anywhere, and is available for both Android and iOS.</p>
<p>This is a feature that allows the monitoring station to reset the control panel remotely, by sending a signal down the telephone line. But we appreciate that you get mobile access and some smart home features through the app on every package—a perk most companies charge extra for. Our security and alarm systems are the best on the market. Comparing home alarm system reviews is the best way to find out what to expect from a company before you sign up for service.</p>
