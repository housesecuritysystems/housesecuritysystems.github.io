If an intruder alarm sensor in your home is triggered we'll respond immediately and contact you. Burglar (or intrusion), fire and safety alarms are commonly found in electronic form today. However, most hardwired systems require professional installation.</p>

If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>
