<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors. Today, the most pop recorders include an NVR (Network Video Recorder), a DVR (Digital Video Recorder), a computer (the hard drive on the computer actually), a Micro SD card, the FTP server, and Cloud.</p>
<p>Smart security systems are highly customizable and available as do-it-yourself kits or as full-blown setups that include professional installation and monitoring.

A digital video surveillance system is a surveillance system that captures images and videos, which can be compressed, stored, or sent over communication networks.</p>
<p>Recent advances in signal processing enable the development of intelligent video surveillance systems, notably systems that can flexibly adapt the rate of video data collection. ADT equipment availability varies from one installer to the next, so the plans offered by SafeStreets might be slightly different than national plans. Vivint wireless security camera systems have eliminated the need for installing bulky and obtrusive wiring that must be run to each camera, as well as offering some convenient features.</p>
