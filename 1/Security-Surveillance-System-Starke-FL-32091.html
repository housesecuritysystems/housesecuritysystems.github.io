<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
<p>Effective home security systems can guard your windows and doors, detect motion inside your home, and automatically contact dispatchers in the case of an emergency. These smart digital cameras can spot motion, detect objects, read vehicle number plates, and even identify human behaviors. Sound the siren on your Ring Alarm from anywhere inside your home and dispatch emergency services with professional monitoring.</p>

<p>Increasing investment from the government in smart city and public security projects in the Asia Pacific region also drives the growth of the video surveillance market. Through a home security app, you can monitor your system and control wireless devices with smart home automation technology, such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and IFTTT.
