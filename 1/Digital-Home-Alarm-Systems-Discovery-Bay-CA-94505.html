<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. It offers indoor cameras, which aren't on a par with our camera picks but allow for Visual Verification, an opt-in feature that permits the monitoring service to view live video in your home to confirm there's an actual emergency before calling the cavalry—a system intended to reduce false alerts (and, as noted above, a requirement in some communities).</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on.
