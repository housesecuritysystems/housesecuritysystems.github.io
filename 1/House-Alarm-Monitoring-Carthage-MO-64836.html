<p>The Mi Home Security Camera Basic 1080p does not store any data on the cloud (unlike Yi, which gives you a 30-day free cloud storage for your video feeds and you can opt for different plans to get more storage) Having a cloud storage is a better option as you are assured that your video feeds are not corrupted in the micro SD card or not lost if the camera itself is stolen or damaged.</p>

In addition to professional installation and monitoring, we perform annual inspections to make sure your business burglar alarm system is up to code and functioning properly.</p>
<p>If you lease rather than own the security equipment, then a long-term monitoring agreement could have the lowest rates.
