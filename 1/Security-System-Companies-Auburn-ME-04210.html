<p>While they have been a staple of home security for decades, how do we know that burglar alarms always work? Popular monitoring solutions include ADT, SimpliSafe, Ring, Nest, etc. When the magnetic connection is broken by opening a door or window that is protected, the alarm is triggered. I used a monitoring service from CardioNet for several years until my insurance decided they wouldn't cover it any more. The largest proportion, 65%, have a deadlocks on doors, 57% have outdoor security lighting and 45% a burglar alarm.</p>

Some cameras can have filters installed that allow better resolution in low-light conditions.</p>
<p>Ideally, all access control points and sterile area screening checkpoints should be fitted with CCTV cameras. Just seeing a security camera will sometimes be enough to keep away those wanting to break in. They'll also be able to capture any questionable activity that you need to follow up on.
