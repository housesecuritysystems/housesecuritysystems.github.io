Companies can add detectors and sensors for fire, smoke, flood, carbon monoxide and even freezing pipes onto your monthly monitoring service for increased protection. The Ultra Series Fingerprint Terminals provide the large fingerprints and cards capacities and comprehensive access control functions for large projects. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides up to 48 sensors in its basic package, including both fire and CO alarms.</p>
