<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Quick action is important during break-ins, and burglar alarms facilitate fast response by alerting people in the vicinity to compromised security as soon as it occurs. The major drawback of IP cameras is their higher price tag. Government initiatives in various countries to install video surveillance cameras in public places such as cities, schools, colleges, religious places, airports, and stations further drive market growth.</p>

Cable 24 serves as a shunt resistor in the sense that whenever current is drawn from or charged to the battery, a voltage is created across cable 24.
