<p>One of the biggest advantages of a wireless camera is the option to control your system's recording schedule. Other ADT home security offerings require a monitoring plan upgrade to get remote control through an app. The vast array of CCTV surveillance cameras and recorders on the market can be daunting, making it difficult to decide which system would be best suited to your home or business environment.</p>

Monitoring fees begin at $29, and equipment costs range from $299 to $499. Whether you need a widespread system that can cover multiple locations or just a few cameras to watch your storefront, there's a solution for everyone.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras. These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible.</p>
