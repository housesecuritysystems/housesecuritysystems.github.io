<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>Our integrated systems put the right cameras in the right places, smart DVRs and NVRs to record and manage your video operations. Rising number of smart homes propelling growth for DIY cameras.

<h3>5 Reasons To Install a Video Security Camera System In Your Home in Eureka</h3>

However, most hardwired systems require professional installation.</p>

The standard Alarm Security Kit is priced at just $199 - cheaper than most competitors - yet comes with a base station, keypad, contact sensor, motion detector and range extender. There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>

In a nutshell, these cameras record both the inside and the outside of your home, and save the footage somewhere (it might be in the cloud, it might be in the device itself, depending which one you buy). Security companies offer packages to save you money, as long as you need all of the equipment that comes in the package.</p>
