Electronic surveillance of employees also ensures your floor manager get more time to work on the critical aspects of their work rather than focusing their entire attention on monitoring people.</p>
<p>You'll also have access to tools for requesting service, viewing invoices, and even monitoring live video feed if cameras are part of your system. The home security market offers many plug-and-play equipment packages that center around an audible alarm to deter intruders who trigger a door or window sensor.
