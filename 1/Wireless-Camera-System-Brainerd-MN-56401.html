<p>DIY installation with self-monitoring: Some brands we recommend, like Ring, Abode, and Nest, offer both professional and self-monitoring. Others like ADT and Vivint offer professionally installed systems only but typically provide their own installers. Expect to pay an extra Nest Aware fee for every camera you install, including the Nest Hello doorbell. In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm.</p>
<p>For this reason, some cameras can also run for a short time on battery power. These types of cameras typically use rechargeable batteries that can be easily popped out and taken indoors for charging with a USB cable, but they tend to drain quickly in colder weather.
