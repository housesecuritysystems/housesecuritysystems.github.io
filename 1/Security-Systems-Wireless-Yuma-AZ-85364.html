It is this voltage drop which provides the basic input signal to the circuitry illustrated in FIG. Be it IP cameras, megapixel cameras, HD-CCTV, video management systems (VMS), DVRs, compression, systems integration, monitors, fiber, analytics, WiFi or mesh networks, you'll find it here.</p>
<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems.
