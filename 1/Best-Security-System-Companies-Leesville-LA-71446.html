Cable 24 serves as a shunt resistor in the sense that whenever current is drawn from or charged to the battery, a voltage is created across cable 24.

Be it IP cameras, megapixel cameras, HD-CCTV, video management systems (VMS), DVRs, compression, systems integration, monitors, fiber, analytics, WiFi or mesh networks, you'll find it here.</p>

It will alert you on your smartphone and email if there is an unnatural motion in the periphery of the camera.</p>
