<p>Low-light-level cameras provide the means to view outside when very little light is available.

<p>Covert CCTV is the practice of using video cameras in locations that are not made obvious to the persons being monitored in the specific cctv camera coverage area, but it is recommended that there is reasonable cause for the purpose of covert surveillance and that its primary objectives are clearly noted, only used for the purposes of preventing crime and are not used for longer than intended.</p>
<p>Several CCTV cameras can be integrated into your smart home, linking up with tech such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Most of the sensors detect opening of a door, window or breakage of glass or movement of human beings. Then, when the light beam is intercepted, the grid voltage is permitted to go to a high negative value, thereby cutting off the plate current and operating the alarm or indicator relay.</p>
