AxxonSoft is a leading developer of Video Management and Physical Security Information Management software. However, it has no self-monitoring option: If you cancel, you lose monitoring, remote access, and all smartphone alerts, though the sensors and sirens will still work, so you can at least set an alarm when you're home at night.</p>

<p>Network Video Recorders (NVR) and analog recorders (VCRs), also available for purchase, work the same way as a DVR, using an internet signal (NVR) or blank tapes (VCR) to record instead of a digital hard-drive. This interest is largely due to increased crime rates and security threats all around the globe, which are driving a continuous growth of the video surveillance market.</p>
<p>We have a huge stock of cameras and CCTV camera equipment to meet your needs. While not an essential requirement for a home security system, all top companies offer a variety of camera options as add-ons. For smart home features, we recommend the ADT Pulse package. ADT is one of the more expensive home security companies, with high-priced video monitoring and steep early termination fees.</p>
