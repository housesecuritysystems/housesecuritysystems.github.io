<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. Video surveillance, access control and alarms have much in common, and they often work together as an integrated system to keep intruders out of secure areas, limit access to security sensitive areas, and remotely monitor critical areas to reduce the risk of crime and security incidents. You can also check out our guide to the best home security cameras for more options.</p>

<h3>Goodbye Webcams, Hello Wireless Internet Camera in Glen Carbon IL 62034</h3>

A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>

There are also wireless IP cameras available that require little more than mounting, but those might be less secure than wired connections.</p>
