<p>The part set exit time is the time needed to get from the control panel to your isolated area, when part-setting the system. Key features that set apart the best home security cameras include night vision, notification alerts, plenty of storage (either locally or in the cloud) for your recorded footage, and microphones to give out voice commands. This is based on user preference, but many security systems are most commonly controlled by a smartphone app, so often times it is sufficient (and easier for guests) to just have a keypad and then utilize the app for controlling the system on a day-to-day basis.</p>

Hello Rupe, we are sorry that you cannot record Reolink cameras to your own web server or cloud since our cameras don't support such network protocols.
