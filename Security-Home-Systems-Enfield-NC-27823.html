<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The surveillance cameras today use AI and deep learning to empower security with more reliability and accuracy. You can schedule the cameras to be on at specific times, you can set up a geofence, so they turn on automatically when you leave home, and you can quickly disarm or snooze individual cameras or the whole system. Sometimes the connections are arranged so as to switch on the electric lights if the house is entered.</p>
<p>The Wyze Cam V2's video is on par with that of most of the cameras on our list. Besides the cost of the equipment, these smart home appliances often charge a monthly fee. Network video servers are designed for IP CCTV cameras over WAN or LAN computer networks where each camera has its own unique IP address.

Whether you need basic wired analog cameras, or you want the latest wireless IP cameras with every advanced feature available, we can address your needs. When selecting CCTV cameras it's important to consider lens size, wide angle degree and memory for data storage.</p>
<p>The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify.
