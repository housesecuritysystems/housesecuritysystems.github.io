<h3>Hidden Security Cameras Vs Overt Surveillance Cameras in New Albany</h3>

The system of video surveillance in the center and adjacent territories and premises is built on basis of remote sensitive video cameras. Depending on how your system is set up, one of two things will happen-either a high-decibel alarm will sound or a silent alarm will be sent to your ADT monitoring station.</p>
