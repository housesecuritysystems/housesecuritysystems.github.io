There have long been well-established rules governing the audio recording of individuals without their consent (there is a reason surveillance cameras never have microphones).</p>
<p>In addition to security, outdoor cameras provide extra accountability. The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is even more sophisticated security camera than the Deep Sentinel, and it's our top recommendation if you don't want to pay for that system's pricey (but arguably worthwhile) human monitoring service.
