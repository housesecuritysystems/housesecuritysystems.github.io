<p>Our video security and information management solution helps you build security systems that will evolve alongside your changing needs. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a PTZ camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>DIY installation with self-monitoring: Some brands we recommend, like Ring, Abode, and Nest, offer both professional and self-monitoring. Others like ADT and Vivint offer professionally installed systems only but typically provide their own installers.
