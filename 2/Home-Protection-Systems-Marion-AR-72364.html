<p>One of the main benefits of video surveillance systems is its ability to ensure full-time monitoring in both the densely populated areas as well as in remote areas. When these sensors are triggered, they send a signal to your security system control panel, which will alert your ADT monitoring station.

Our door and window alarms help detect break-ins, and our optional glass break sensors are prepared for all situations; if intruders bypass the usual sensors by breaking the glass as opposed to picking the locks, the glass break sensors will sound an alarm.</p>
