A couple of weeks ago, the RWA of our building society sent chest thumping e-mails to residents about how the number of CCTV cameras in the residential complex had been increased to 100.</p>
<p>The circuit includes an alarm bell and battery, and the latter begins to ring and continues until stopped, either by the closing of the door or by a switch being turned. Whether you need basic wired analog cameras, or you want the latest wireless IP cameras with every advanced feature available, we can address your needs. When selecting CCTV cameras it's important to consider lens size, wide angle degree and memory for data storage.</p>
<p>With a special feature of motion capture, any movement in front of the camera would be detected and the footage along with photos sent both to the house owners and also to the police, following which the police patrol teams would be directed to the house. And some cameras have special features that go beyond those basics.
