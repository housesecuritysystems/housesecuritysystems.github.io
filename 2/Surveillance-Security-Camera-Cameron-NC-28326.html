With a mile-long list of device options, we think Nest Secure is one of the best smart home security systems around. To the Point: Professionally installed security systems require an installation fee, but you don't have to lift a finger.</p>
<p>And they won't use your WiFi or slow it down unless you access the security cameras for remote viewing or the cameras send you alerts when motion is detected. With ADT home security packages, you get more than just a smart security system. The system can also be expanded with options for indoor and outdoor cameras, and compatible Yale electronic locks. Bottom Line: Vivint is a high-end wireless system that offers same day professional installation.</p>
