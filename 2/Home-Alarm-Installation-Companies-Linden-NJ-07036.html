<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Homeowners can choose from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can record footage when an alarm is triggered, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, nanny cameras, and more. Monitoring fees begin at $29, and equipment costs range from $299 to $499. Whether you need a widespread system that can cover multiple locations or just a few cameras to watch your storefront, there's a solution for everyone.</p>

<p>Some security cameras have very high quality images, so you don't have to stare at fuzzy pictures you can't make out. Based around the Hub, you get a Multi Sensor, for doors and windows, a Motion Sensor, Presence Sensor that lets you know people arrive or leave home and a Power Outlet plug that controls anything plugged into it. The second connection is a sense input along line 28 to the negative terminal of the battery to pick up the voltage drop across battery cable 24. Finally, a power lead 30 serves to connect the circuitry to the positive battery terminal 12 so that the circuitry will have operating power.</p>
