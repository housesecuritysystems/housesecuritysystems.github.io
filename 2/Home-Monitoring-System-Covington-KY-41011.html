<p>Smart home automation technology is increasingly popular in security systems. In today's market, there are three main types of security system packages available: home automation, security equipment, and environmental monitoring. The use of sophisticated systems by police and other public security officials is particularly troubling in a democratic society. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is recording.</p>

<h3>Home Security Systems: More Than Simply Having An Alarm In Place in Covington</h3>
<p>During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be somewhat easy to set up and use — but not quite as simple as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.
