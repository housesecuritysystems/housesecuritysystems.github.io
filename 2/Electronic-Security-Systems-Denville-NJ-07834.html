<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. This allows you to remotely arm and disarm your home's security system, display video monitoring, control temperature and lights, receive alerts and custom notifications, as well as lock and unlock doors. Today, the most pop recorders include an NVR (Network Video Recorder), a DVR (Digital Video Recorder), a computer (the hard drive on the computer actually), a Micro SD card, the FTP server, and Cloud.</p>
<p>You'll also have access to tools for requesting service, viewing invoices, and even monitoring live video feed if cameras are part of your system. The home security market offers many plug-and-play equipment packages that center around an audible alarm to deter intruders who trigger a door or window sensor.

<p>SimpliSafe could be considered a disrupter in the home security industry, because it was among the first to provide forward-thinking customer benefits like self-installation, self-monitoring, video verification and month-to-month pricing.

<p>For more sensitive control of the door, there is an advanced version called Balanced Magnetic Switch, in which the electrical contact of the switch is held in no-alarm condition by two magnets - one is fixed to the door frame and the other magnet is fixed to the corresponding position on to the door. DVRs capture footage from analog cameras in a digital format at the desired resolution and frames per second.</p>
<p>You can then connect elements to it, depending on the system you choose, including motion sensors, cameras, and lighting sockets that allow you to switch lights on and off when you're out. CCTV placement will depend on factors including lighting and the purpose of the camera: a fixed camera watches over a fixed area such as an access control point; a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera offers a wider field of view, the ability to move the camera, and a zoom capability.</p>
<p>As adjuncts to the system the treads of the stairs are sometimes arranged to ring the bell, by completing a circuit when trod on. Door mats are also arranged to close circuits in like manner. To make sure these are as discreet as possible, installation is normally carried out by an alarm company, however, some DIY options are available. Brinks has pretty standard equipment, but we love its smart monitoring alerts.</p>
