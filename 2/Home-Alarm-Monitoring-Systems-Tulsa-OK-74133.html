Typically employing a modest number of fixed cameras to record customer activity, NVR solutions in these environments are able to employ lower image resolution and fewer frames per second while still delivering sufficient video detail for subsequent review as needed.</p>
<p>Although its unfamiliar to a lot of Indians, DIY Home Security Systems are highly popular and trust worthy for millions of people in the western countries as one of the most effective and convenient security solutions.

The output of flip-flop 74 is directly connected to a second input of OR gate 90. This instantly activates sounding timer 92 and the alarm is sounded for two minutes until reset due to the action of one shot 94, as described above.</p>
<p>Increasing investment from the government in smart city and public security projects in the Asia Pacific region also drives the growth of the video surveillance market. Through a home security app, you can monitor your system and control wireless devices with smart home automation technology, such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and IFTTT.
