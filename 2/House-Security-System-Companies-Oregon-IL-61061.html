<p>2. If you have ticked record audio in the camera settings and still get no audio, please make sure you have upgraded your security cameras and the NVR to the latest version. These easy-to-use wireless security systems safeguard your home and put loads of smart commands at your fingertips.

<p>These cameras are extremely useful in defence locations, in border areas, and other places where you need 24X7 surveillance activities. Appointing security guards is a traditional practice, but with developing technology, a number of surveillance aids are made available. Former New Haven Chief of Police Anthony Campbell told me how ShotSpotters , controversial devices that listen for gunshots, integrate with specialized software so when a gun is fired, nearby swivel cameras instantly alter their direction to the location of the weapons discharge.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a huge difference between the latest smart home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest smart products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate everything to work with other smart gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-encompassing smart home, not just a burglar alarm.</p>
