Video surveillance is an important application that utilizes shared storage resources.

A wide range of products are available in Security & Surveillance Cameras section to offer the best to you.

When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>

<p>Home alarm systems not only protect homes from potential thieves, they also protect family members from violent intruders, they can allow parents to prevent children from using potentially unsafe appliances when home alone, and can alert homeowners to fire, smoke, and the presence of dangerous carbon monoxide.
