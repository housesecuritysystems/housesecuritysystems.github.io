<p>Safety is vital and surveillance technology required to achieve this is becoming increasingly challenging and complex. Our selection of DIY home security equipment, Fingerprint Door Locks and surveillance cameras is second to none, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. After you download and install the Ooma Smart Security mobile app to your iOS (Apple) or Android device and pair one or more of the wireless sensors, you can install the products throughout your home and get peace of mind knowing that you will receive alerts whenever unexpected activity occurs.</p>
<p>Most smart home cameras now link up to an app, like the Nest or Ring app, to monitor your home when you are on the move. When the security system is armed at the control panel, these sensors communicate with it by reporting that the point of entry is secure. Power sensors can also notify you indirectly of an emergency, say, if your sump pump or well pump unexpectedly turns on. Eaton also offers a water shutoff controller: Install the motor-driven valve on the supply pipe, then position wireless water sensors anywhere you fear a leak.</p>
