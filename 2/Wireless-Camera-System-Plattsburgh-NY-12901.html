<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>
<p>You'll also have access to tools for requesting service, viewing invoices, and even monitoring live video feed if cameras are part of your system. The home security market offers many plug-and-play equipment packages that center around an audible alarm to deter intruders who trigger a door or window sensor.
