<p>A smart TV, media players connected to the TV, smart lights, smart appliances, smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, smart displays such as Amazon Echo Show and Google Nest Hub, smart cameras, a water purifier or air purifier that connects with the internet and so on. The thing is, none of these smart devices have any security built in. That is where Akita steps in and adds a layer that analyses the data packets being to and from these smart devices on your network—and immediately raises an alarm if something is amiss.</p>

Honeywell's Smart Home Security System is a DIY kit. CCTV recorders ensure photos and videos to be captured in higher resolution.</p>
<p>There's widespread concern that video cameras will use facial recognition software to track our every public move. It's always wiser to invest in a good quality, small, entry level system that allows you to add more cameras later on, than to rush out and buy an unbranded cheap camera, that could lead to buyer's remorse. Using the garage door controller, manage your garage using the Vivint Smart Home app and receive notifications if your garage door is open or if it failed to close.</p>
