Presently, 65 cameras could cover 20 to 25 houses at the same time and number of cameras will be decided based on the size of the house.

<p>So, whether it is recognizing fire hazard at a warehouse or counting people at a retail store, identifying aggressive behavior (or theft) and spontaneously letting the security officer or monitoring staff performance in a hotel, hospital, or an educational institute, the IP-driven solutions have unlocked unprecedented opportunities by leveraging video analytics, which isn't possible using conventional analog-based devices.</p>
<p>With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. Manufacturers promote the use of spy cameras for various applications with the advent of AI, BIG data analytics, cloud computing, and face recognition options. However, factors such as high investment cost and lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras, hamper the market growth.</p>

Brinks has pretty standard equipment, but we love its smart monitoring alerts.</p>
