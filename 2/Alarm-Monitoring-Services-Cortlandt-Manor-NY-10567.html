<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. Moreover, cameras can be placed in areas that require security such as parking spots, VIP areas, schools, restaurants & hotels, bank locker rooms, hospitals, etc.</p>
<p>Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that gives you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it easy to find a video event that took place at a specific point in time. Video surveillance hardware has followed the same evolutionary track as photographic cameras. These closed-loop systems are more secure but being able to expand and include other smart home products such as Philips Hue lighting and or Nest heating won't be possible.</p>

<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>If IC Realtime represents the generic end of the market, Boulder shows what a boutique contractor can do. In both cases, though, what these firms are currently offering is just the tip of the iceberg. Growing concern about public safety is prompting wider deployment of video surveillance by government agencies, private organizations, and consumers. Wired systems, on the other hand, need wires running to each of the sensors to work - more than half of people we surveyed have a wired alarm (52%).</p>
