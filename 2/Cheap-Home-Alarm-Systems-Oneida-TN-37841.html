<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms.

If there is no internet, the camera stores the video feed on the camera's micro SD card where you can access it from your smartphone and view it at your convenience. Right now Nest Secure has a few gaps in its security features (like an alarm that automatically delays by 30 seconds), but it's still worth considering—especially if all you need is basic home security that you can monitor yourself.</p>
