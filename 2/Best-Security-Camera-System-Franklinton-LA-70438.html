When those sensors hear an alarm, both you and the monitoring center are notified and emergency help is dispatched if needed. Home Value Monitoring is free, and it only takes a minute to set up. Just enter the address of the property you want to monitor â€” it's that easy.</p>
<p>Customizable security features: Consumers can choose the plan with the features they want, from basic monitoring, two-way voice communication, home automation, video monitoring and more.

<p>All of the systems we've tested feature an app that lets you use your smartphone as your command center to arm and disarm the system, create rules, add and delete components, and receive push notifications when alarms are triggered. If it notices something that is out of the ordinary, which is usually when someone is attempting to do mischief with your smart devices such as smart cameras or smart thermostat, Akita will detect the incoming packets of traffic on the network for intrusion attempts and block access before notifying you.</p>
