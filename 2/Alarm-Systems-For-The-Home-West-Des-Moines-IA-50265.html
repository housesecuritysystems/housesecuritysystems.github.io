<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike. Founded in 1999, Vivint has positioned itself as a next generation home security services provider with an emphasis on home automation and integration with smart home devices.</p>

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) has quickly become significant security equipment for safety and monitoring purposes. A single four rack unit E-Series chassis can be configured with up to 480TB in capacity, making it 10X more dense with an improvement in rack space efficiency of up to 5X over that of other Digital Video Surveillance offerings.</p>

<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry.

Usually, they are black and white cameras that do not have very high resolution.
