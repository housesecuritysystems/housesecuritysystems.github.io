<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms.

<p>Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the increasing penetration of home security systems, the DIY systems become an attractive alternative for newer customers with average disposable incomes. Though some burglar alarms are successfully triggered by the unexpected motion caused by break-ins, studies have shown that an audible alarm may not always have the intended effect. In general, the customer reviews regarding the quality of service are positive, which can sometimes be hard to find in the home security business.</p>
<p>All of these cameras can be integrated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. Arlo builds great home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company is capable of. While it doesn't have the eye-popping 4K resolution of the Arlo Ultra, it delivers fantastic video quality and many of that more-expensive camera's other signature features for less.</p>
