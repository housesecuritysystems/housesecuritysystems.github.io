<h3>Factors to Consider When Buying a Home Security Camera in Antelope</h3>

<p>Box cameras present an obvious sign for anyone who passes by that they are being recorded on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and crime. Furthermore, there are impressive integration features for many popular smart home devices, including Nest Thermostat, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>With a special feature of motion capture, any movement in front of the camera would be detected and the footage along with photos sent both to the house owners and also to the police, following which the police patrol teams would be directed to the house. And some cameras have special features that go beyond those basics. Hikvision's development of an AI cloud software platform and its adoption will promote the growth of IoT as well as advance the integration of IoT with information networks; it will also help develop the company's Big Data business.</p>
