The EufyCam 2C is an impressive wireless home security camera system that offers a great range of features for a very affordable price.

No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more common.</p>
<p>However, combined with the compatible locks, alarms, webcams and sensors, you can create a seriously secure home. It also offers different monitoring plans based on the desired connectivity - landline, broadband or cellular.
