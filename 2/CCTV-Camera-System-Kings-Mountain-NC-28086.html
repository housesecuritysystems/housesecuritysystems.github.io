<p>Human beings who monitor and respond to suspicious activity detected by its security cameras set the Deep Sentinel home surveillance system apart from anything else on the market.

Wireless burglar alarms work similarly to wired ones, but the sensors communicate with the control panel via a radio frequency.</p>
<p>The part set exit time is the time needed to get from the control panel to your isolated area, when part-setting the system. Key features that set apart the best home security cameras include night vision, notification alerts, plenty of storage (either locally or in the cloud) for your recorded footage, and microphones to give out voice commands.
