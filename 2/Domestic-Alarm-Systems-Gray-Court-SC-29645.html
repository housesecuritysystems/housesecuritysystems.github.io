<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. If you wish to keep an eye on your caregiver hired to take care of your kids or the elderly in the family or even your pets, you can do so remotely with the help of security surveillance cameras installed in different parts of the house. Using the ADT mobile app, you can quickly check any or all of your ADT home security cameras, and even talk with people at your front door.</p>
<p>By 2020, the country hopes to have 570 million speed cameras to help develop a database that will recognize any citizen within three seconds.

<p>A smart TV, media players connected to the TV, smart lights, smart appliances, smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, smart displays such as Amazon Echo Show and Google Nest Hub, smart cameras, a water purifier or air purifier that connects with the internet and so on.

Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
<p>Look for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and smart switches. Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now. Set up your system to send you alerts and notifications on your mobile device when cameras detect motion or a door opens, so you know what's happening at home.</p>
