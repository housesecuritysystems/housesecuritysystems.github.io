Capable of operating in both normal and poorly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not requiring inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can capture clear video images in the dark thanks to their extra sensitive imaging chips. Moreover, cameras can be placed in areas that require security such as parking spots, VIP areas, schools, restaurants & hotels, bank locker rooms, hospitals, etc.</p>
<p>These types of cameras allow for discreet placement which means you can capture good footage of theft and criminal damage. Likewise with circuits from a burglar alarm that are designated as fire zones or circuits, these would be covered by Article 760.
