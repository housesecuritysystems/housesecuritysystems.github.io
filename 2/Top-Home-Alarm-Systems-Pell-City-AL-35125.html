From this vacuum tu e conductors 96 may lead to bridge the wires 41. The bulb 92 is normally screenedfrom the cell 94 by a rubber plate 93 which allows only infrared light rays to pass through it, and the cell 94 may be of such a character that it can only be actuated by these infra red rays to energize the tube 95 and close the circuit through ythe conductors 41.
