Since lighting is also dependent on motion being detected in each room, you'll save money on your electricity bill as an added bonus with indoor motion sensors. We often compare the ability of our human sight to what we expect cameras to do.

<p>The camera also has a night vision feature but just like daytime video recording, footages taken at night look a little underpowered. Pair your sensors with the Ooma Home Security app, and select your notification settings.
