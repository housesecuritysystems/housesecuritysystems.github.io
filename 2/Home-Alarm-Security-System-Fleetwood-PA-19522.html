<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>Take charge of your home security with a CCTV surveillance system that is discreet, high-powered, and built to last. Archive footage is stored on network video recorders (NVRs) or on secure software for later access. They will also know how to maintain their own systems and prevent or lessen false alarms.

When an alarm goes off, it should, in theory, stop a burglar in their tracks, or at least raise awareness of the crime to passers-by; someone may look out of their window and see an unfamiliar figure approaching the property across the street, therefore being able to act as a witness if the authorities become involved.</p>
<p>Vivint's monthly monitoring service plans aren't too expensive, but its equipment costs a pretty penny. The company features some helpful installation videos on the Scout website, where you can also find additional recommendations and installation tips. There are three types of cameras based on lighting and resolution. These type of sensors are very common and are found either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>

The advent of 360o cameras equipped with video de-warping technology is eliminating the need to deploy 3 to 4 PTZ (or the standard CCTV) cameras to cover a single region, as a single device can now effectively do the same.
