<h3>Arguments and Reasons For Using Video Surveillance in Camp Lejeune</h3>

Depending on the manufacturer, your home security camera will store different amounts of footage for different lengths of time.</p>
<p>The primary function of a cctv camera is to convert light into a video signal, all cctv cameras require an optical lens to focus the light onto an image sensor located directly behind the lens inside the cctv camera.

<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at. A camera that captures video at 720p will usually offer a fairly sharp picture, but 1080p video offers more detail and is the most popular resolution for these devices; it doesn't require lots of storage capacity and can be viewed on nearly all phones, tablets, and PCs.</p>

Wired home security installation costs start around $100, though some companies offer discount installations for new customers.
