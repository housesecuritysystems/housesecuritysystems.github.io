Reviewers found that the Nest Secure system was easy to install, with the small sensors easily fitting into corners in hallways and on door frames.

However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas).

DIY systems are also modular, so you can easily add sensors and devices as you need themâ€”perhaps a camera by the garage, say, or sensors on the sliding glass door upstairs.
