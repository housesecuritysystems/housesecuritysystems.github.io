<p>Many people who are looking for DIY home security solutions want systems that they can install and monitor themselves. DIY systems are also modular, so you can easily add sensors and devices as you need them—perhaps a camera by the garage, say, or sensors on the sliding glass door upstairs.

<p>Video image processing ( VIP ) identifies vehicles and their associated traffic flow parameters by analysing imagery supplied from CCTV cameras which normally have a fixed field of view. It has to be noted that this is the number of CCTV cameras available with the police and not the total number of CCTV cameras in the state. Multiple streams and angles of high-resolution surveillance comes with a price, requiring up to 20 times more storage capacity that lower-resolution video captured with older technology.</p>
