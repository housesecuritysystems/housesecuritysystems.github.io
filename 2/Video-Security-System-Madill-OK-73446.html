<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. ADT security systems require professional installation. Digital cameras are becoming the industry standard for their resolution and the ability to store tons of data on hard drives, rather than videotapes. As you compare home security systems, it helps to understand the difference between wired or wireless systems and monitored or unmonitored alarms. Find a provider that offers an appropriate trial period to allow time for you to test out of your equipment.</p>
<p>With most DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly fees if you decide to self-monitor. Alarm Relay is a TMA Five Diamond monitoring center. Although video motion detection and video analytics (Chapter 7) apply technology to identify anomalies that human observers may miss, security management should take action to reduce fatigue and ensure good-quality viewing.</p>
