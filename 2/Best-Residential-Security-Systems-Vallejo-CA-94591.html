Offers may not be combined with certain other promotional offers on the same services and may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. Most security systems require a monthly payment for monitoring and a one-time payment for the equipment. You do not want to have a long entry time as a burglar entering through a delay zone has the same amount of time in your protected area before the alarm goes off.</p>
<p>If you go with the higher tiers of service, the company also installs and connects the smart home devices and sets up the apps that control them. The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of vision, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>

<p>Nest thoughtfully designs its equipment and packages too; it includes two key fobs with every security equipment package—that's normally an add-on. It's professionally installed, it will look good in your house, and it supports a ton of smart home devices. The Eufy Security app also offers the ability to set activity zones, so you can draw a box on the screen to specify the area you're interested in. This is vital if you have a camera that overlooks a busy road, for example.</p>
