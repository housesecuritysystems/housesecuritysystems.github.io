In the following three examples, the varying video profiles of different security environments (and the storage capacities they require) are compared.</p>
<p>Customizable security features: Consumers can choose the plan with the features they want, from basic monitoring, two-way voice communication, home automation, video monitoring and more. So, it was not clear whether increasing CCTV cameras had any real benefits or worsened the security in the building.
