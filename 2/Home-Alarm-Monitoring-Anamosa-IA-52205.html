<p>The Vivint Smart Home system is the best home security system as it's the most sophisticated and customizable systems on offer. While these tools make the monitoring process somewhat more accessible and more visually appealing than executing command line SQL queries as described above, they don't support automated alerting, which is a crucial element of an effective monitoring solution.</p>
<p>The software segment of the video surveillance market is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Understand resolution: The higher the resolution number, the sharper the image will be. Entry level camera resolution is 330 lines, high resolution cameras producing better than 400 lines.

These sensors detect infrared energy, enabling them to detect dramatic increases of heat in a room - such as would occur when a burglar enters an otherwise empty room.</p>

With so many security applications entailing dozens of cameras and 24×7 video streams, it soon becomes apparent that a typical NVR system's storage requirements can easily reach beyond 10 TB. In the following three examples, the varying video profiles of different security environments (and the storage capacities they require) are compared.</p>
<p>Customizable security features: Consumers can choose the plan with the features they want, from basic monitoring, two-way voice communication, home automation, video monitoring and more. So, it was not clear whether increasing CCTV cameras had any real benefits or worsened the security in the building.
