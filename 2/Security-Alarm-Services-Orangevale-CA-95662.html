An alert's processing time, or response time,” can depend on the system setup, monitoring center technology, staff training, and other factors. The system also integrates with smart home devices from other manufacturers, including Arlo home security cameras and the August Smart Lock Pro These can be installed at the same time as the system or added in later on.

<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud. The main difference between the two is that the Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera has a more robust design and is built to be weatherproof, rain or shine. This factor helps in driving the growth of the CCTV camera market.
