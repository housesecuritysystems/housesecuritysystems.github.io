<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189). Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>
<p>Where movable cctv cameras are used a zoom lens is usually fitted to allow varying points of a monitored area to be viewed. Appropriate help is summoned when the alarm is activated, whether you are home or not, even when the security system is not armed. It will alert you on your smartphone and email if there is an unnatural motion in the periphery of the camera.</p>

The network IP cameras have unique features not usually observed in the conventional cameras. The audio and video analytics software provides timely alerts to make surveillance systems more proactive, accurate and efficient.</p>
<p>Also mobile devices like tablets, smartphones and body-worn cameras can be connected safely to your video security system. A few cameras will even let you save video to a portable USB or NAS drive, but these devices are few and far between. Big Data systems provide the means for creating and implementing video surveillance architectures that scale in a seamless and cost-effective way.</p>
<p>There are also rising concerns over people's privacy that is interrupted by excessive use of CCTV cameras worldwide. A more affordable alternative to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include many of the same features as their monitored counterpart, including sensors, alarms, and cameras, but they are not observed by a security service, meaning homeowners will not be paying the costly monthly expenses associated with monitored security systems.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Hidden Surveillance Cameras in Leesville LA 71446</h3>
<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry.

Usually, they are black and white cameras that do not have very high resolution. Real-time alarm notifications, sirens, video recording, and easy viewing make it one of the best home security systems in the Indian market.</p>
