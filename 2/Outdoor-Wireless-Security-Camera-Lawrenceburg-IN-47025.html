The systems are designed to detect and analyze incoming electronic signals received from the sensor cable, and then to generate alarms from signals which exceed preset conditions. The police would visit their house and install the WiFi modem and other camera equipment. This control panel has its own power supply, so the burglar cannot cut off the power before breaching the perimeter.</p>
<p>The key players profiled in the video surveillance industry include HKVISION, Ltd., Bosch Security System, Honeywell Security Group, Dahua Technology, FLIR, Panasonic, Avigilon, Axis Communication, Infinova, and Pelco. For example, Simplisafe features high-quality DIY (no tools required!) security equipment with a wide variety of plans, plenty of add-on equipment options, and no contract requirements.</p>
