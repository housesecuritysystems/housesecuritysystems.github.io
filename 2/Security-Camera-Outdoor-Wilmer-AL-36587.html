<p>Burglary is an unwanted event that no one wants to happen their premises. We have a 'model city program' in a foreign country (AFRICA) that will have 5G Communication Technology and it will need a variety of Wireless Video surveillance solutions from transportation, plate identification, government, campus video surveillance, schools, and business parks and banking institutions surveillance, commercial applications, as well as residential neighborhoods.</p>
<p>You use this cost-effective indoor motion sensor along with a SkylinkHome receiver to ensure lights are activated any time motion is detected in the room. In 2019, of the total 4.27 Lakh CCTV cameras used by the police in the country, more than 2.75 Lakh cameras or 64.4% of the total, were installed in Telangana.

<p>For low-end products, it starts from 300INR, the wireless indoor camera starts from 1200INR & a CCTV set up kit with 4 cameras will cost approx 15-20k INR.

Usually, the governments release tenders for installation, maintenance and operation of these CCTV cameras available with the police.</p>
