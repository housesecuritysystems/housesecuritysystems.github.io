<p>These cameras are extremely useful in defence locations, in border areas, and other places where you need 24X7 surveillance activities. Appointing security guards is a traditional practice, but with developing technology, a number of surveillance aids are made available.

<p>Many unmonitored security systems offer self-monitored solutions. Legally, problems arise if your camera captures areas where your neighbors have an expectation of privacy (for example, if your cameras can see into their bedrooms or bathrooms) or if you use the footage for non-security purposes. Value Series Fingerprint Terminals perform the basic functions of access control and time attendance.</p>
