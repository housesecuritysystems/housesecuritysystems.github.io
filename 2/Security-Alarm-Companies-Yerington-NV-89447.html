<p>Standalone access control systems control the entry & exit of individuals, the most basic kind of access control available in the industry. If you hold down the panic or fire alarm buttons on the burglar alarms touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched immediately. Usually, they are black and white cameras that do not have very high resolution. Real-time alarm notifications, sirens, video recording, and easy viewing make it one of the best home security systems in the Indian market.</p>
<p>One policeman, making sure to cover his face, approaches the CCTV camera and breaks it. There are three types of CCTV surveillance cameras on the market, from the most affordable entry level analogue cameras to High Definition (HD) and Internet Protocol (IP) cameras at the top end of the market.
