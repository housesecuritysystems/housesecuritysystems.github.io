<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>Working with customers and partners, Senstar can adapt solutions with the most appropriate technology to address the level of security required and budget available. IP cameras feature digital image sensors with high image resolutions, onboard web server, DVR storage, video analytics, Dual Image Sensor, Power over Ethernet Connectivity, and low power operation making it suitable for remote industrial video surveillance.</p>

Nest Secure comes with DIY and professional installation options, and the system is controlled through the Nest app. If you want to keep it DIY but add more home automation, Abode , Ring Alarm , or Nest Secure will work better for you.</p>
<p>The best-known use of this technology is facial recognition and predictive analytics; intelligent software analyses objects, behaviours, and, in some cases, even faces in stored surveillance footage, comparing the video to known risks that the system is trained to identify.
