SimpliSafe has earned this spot with easy DIY setup, fast response times, and an impressive lineup of home automation features. With Vivint wireless security camera systems, there are no wires to alert intruders that they are being monitored, and the network signal will still transmit even if the power goes out. The associated technology is transitioning from standalone and analog video to networked (IP) and digital video.</p>
