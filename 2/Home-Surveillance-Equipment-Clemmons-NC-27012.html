<p>Video surveillance has evolved from a quaint deployment of analog CCTV cameras to a market driven by digital transformation initiatives such as Smart Cities, IoT, and cloud.

After installation of CCTV cameras the footage can be accessed round-the-clock with the help of another app ‘EZVIZ' by the house owners. Electronic surveillance of employees also ensures your floor manager get more time to work on the critical aspects of their work rather than focusing their entire attention on monitoring people.</p>

Unlike traditional CCTV cameras or home surveillance cameras, you can put Alfred wherever you need to strengthen security.

The only time the communicator will transmit to the monitoring station is in an alarm condition or on a test call. All SimpliSafe security systems are DIY installation and renter friendly.
