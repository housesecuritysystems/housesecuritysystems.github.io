IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate power source, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.</p>
<p>Analog cameras have been around for years and are still the most common type of CCTV camera installed today. In the event your battery is low, a low-battery signal will be sent to your ADT monitoring center so you can be notified.
