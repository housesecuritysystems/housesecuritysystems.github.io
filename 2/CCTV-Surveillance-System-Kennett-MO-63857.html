<p>Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) is a complex of equipment and software meant for monitoring the territory, activities and situations. Abode is a good choice if you want to skip professional monitoring and keep an eye on your home or apartment yourself. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be instantly displayed on a remote monitor, not to mention recorded. Digital Video Recorders (DVRs) have the advantage of being able to convert the analogue PAL signal into a digital signal at various resolutions, the downside is, that the higher the resolution of the image recorded, the larger the file size of that digital image.</p>
<p>The ownership of the CCTV cameras and broadband network will remain with the BSNL. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for security applications such as video surveillance to monitor and record borders, ports, transportation infrastructure, corporate houses, educational institutes, public places, buildings, and others. Plus, the base is compatible with a range of cameras and motion sensors, so you can expand your home security system in the future.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reported in February 2014 that new aerial video surveillance technologies are being deployed that can monitor virtually everything in an area the size of a small city. The video information recorded is limited by the amount of cctv cameras on the system and the length of time the VCR is set to record for. ADT security systems work with popular Z-Wave-enabled smart home brands to connect smart lights, smart thermostats and other smart home security equipment.</p>
