The video surveillance market is highly competitive, owing to strong presence of the existing vendors.</p>
<p>Compared to equipment offered by other home security providers, Protect America's may not be the most impressive, but their door and windows sensors, indoor and outdoor cameras and glass-break detectors are all sturdy and functional.

Most wireless systems include Wi-Fi cameras - or IP cameras - that work with a smartphone app for remote control access, cloud storage and livestream footage. While wireless home security systems are popular and known for an easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more reliable because they aren't subject to interference.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe was one of the first DIY home security systems to hit stores and is a reasonable alternative to ADT and other professional firms.
