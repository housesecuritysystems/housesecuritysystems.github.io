<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. The majority of security systems come with wireless sensors that can be placed in strategic locations around your home, like on doors or windows and in living rooms and bedrooms. Once all connected together, if someone opens a window or door, or walks past a sensor, you will receive an alert on your phone. Pacific Controls offers an innovative, reliable and secure solution - Video Surveillance as a Service to meet the objective of implementing video surveillance solution for inland security.</p>
