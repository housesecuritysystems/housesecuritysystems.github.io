<p>A closed-circuit television camera or CCTV camera is a security system, which captures the video of the surrounding and relays it directly to the screen that is connected to the camera. NetApp is transforming its video surveillance infrastructure, combining its own E-Series video surveillance storage solution with Axis cameras and the Milestone video management system to improve physical security and drive operational efficiencies. Cameras that allow you to remotely view live-streaming video often give you a set amount of cloud storage for those video files, or they only give you access to the cloud if you pay the monitoring fee.</p>
<p>Where Ring is the default option for many elements of home security, Nest is the go-to for indoor security cameras.

Multiple streams and angles of high-resolution surveillance comes with a price, requiring up to 20 times more storage capacity that lower-resolution video captured with older technology.</p>
