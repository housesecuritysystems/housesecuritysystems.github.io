<p>Heightened physical security concerns spanning all industries, coupled with technological advancements is driving the requirement for higher camera resolutions, more fields of view with wider dynamic range and longer storage retention periods. Planting cameras at crucial and suitable points is a cost-effective way to monitor and document people and vehicles arriving and departing certain facility. Additionally, devices that connect via Wi-Fi, such as security cameras and smart door locks, can be hacked to gain access to your home network. And some brands don't sell smart equipment of their own but do integrate with common smart home systems.</p>

<p>Other features that differentiate the Maximus from its better-known competitor—the Ring Floodlight Cam—include pre-recorded messages that can be triggered by the camera's motion detector (causing the intruder to instinctively look up at the camera) and a subscription service that's actually optional: You can look back only two hours and you're limited to three downloads per month if you don't subscribe, where Ring gives you only real-time viewing and no downloads if you don't pay.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the increasing penetration of home security systems, the DIY systems become an attractive alternative for newer customers with average disposable incomes.
