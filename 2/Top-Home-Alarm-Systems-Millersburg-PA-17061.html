<p>CCTV cameras play an important part in road network management. Ella can recognize hundreds of thousands of natural language queries, letting users search footage to find clips showing specific animals, people wearing clothes of a certain color, or even individual car makes and models. These Decoders are equipped with powerful capabilities and can manage a flexible display of IP cameras on LCD video walls. When a door or window is shut, the contact of the door or window in the frame is detected by door and window sensors.</p>
<p>While most CCTV camera systems easily capture 30 or more frames per second (30 fps is considered real time), the amount of video tape or digital storage would be enormous to record every moment of everyday. That's why self-monitoring home security systems are exploding in popularity among homeowners and renters alike.
