This can really depend on how large the area you want to monitor is. The average home might need multiple cameras to cover the whole thing which could quickly add up to hundreds of pounds.</p>
<p>Smart device integration: If you have a home full of smart devices, consider looking for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that includes a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or—eventually a Thread—radio that can connect them.
