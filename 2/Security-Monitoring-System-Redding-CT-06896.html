A fully programmable environmental monitoring system, the Sensaphone 800 allows both local and remote monitoring and control of your home or small business.

Don't settle for cheap, low quality camera systems from big box stores will leave you unsatisfied with video clarity they have to offer, or the lack of support from a call center located halfway around the world.</p>
<p>However, we think you'll like Vivint's award-winning Sky App, which made it ultra-easy to access and control our system remotely. You can see who's at your doorstep using this surveillance camera's 10.9-centimetre screen, and you can even use it to engage in a conversation with the person and then unlock the door if you want.
