<p>That means even if you don't pay the monthly fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it detects a threat, but you are responsible for contacting emergency services such as the police or fire departmentâ€”so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field alerts, even at 2:00 a.m. It's nice that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't always want that responsibility, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>Smart door locks add a whole new level of security and convenience to a smart ADT security system, allowing you to easily let people in - or keep them out - remotely.
