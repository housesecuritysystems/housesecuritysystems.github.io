<h3>What to Consider Before You Buy a Home Security System in Austin</h3>
<p>As the crime rate is increasing day by day and burglars are becoming smarter by every passing day, the security system for commercial setups likebanks, shops and houses need to be fool proof. Take ELAN's Video Intercom System anywhere in the world, with the intuitive mobile app, smart enough to play any of the custom tones when the app is open, and send push notifications when the app is not open.</p>
<p>Additional sensors can also be added at a fairly low cost, like a $70 smoke detector, additional motion detectors for $40 and a $120 camera that can be used indoors or outside. It's well worth investing time in researching home security systems in order to gain peace of mind knowing that you've chosen the right system to protect your home and family. Do I really need a home security system - while most people think of home security systems as a way to protect their homes from burglaries, what many people may not realize is that these systems can also protect homes from fires as well - a must, literally, to have a home security camera system.</p>
<p>It's a shame the cameras can't be linked to the sensors - taking a pic if the door is opened, for instance - but a software update was promised at time of writing. ADT now offers a full DIY home security system called Blue by ADT Blue by ADT is the result of ADT's acquisition and merger with LifeShield. Customizable home security packages are available with professional monitoring or self-monitoring.</p>
<p>It's also compatible with a number of other smarthome devices, which can be configured so that even when you are away, indoor and outdoor lighting can be programmed to simulate someone at home. This makes it possible to receive notifications regarding anything peculiar your cameras records—such as movement inside your business at 3:00 am—and view it live from anywhere via a computer or smartphone.</p>

So, it was not clear whether increasing CCTV cameras had any real benefits or worsened the security in the building. Protect Your Home requires professional equipment installation but the good news is the installation fee is already included in the upfront package costs.</p>
