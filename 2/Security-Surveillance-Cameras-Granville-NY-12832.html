Control room operators depend on the CCTV camera images - displayed either on their work-stations or large-scale on a video wall”.

Addressing concerns about the over-reliance on cameras, Mr. Viswanathan says he does not see CCTVs as a solution to every problem.</p>
<p>Cost-effective network video recording servers. We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Kit because it includes all the basics (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a few extra entry sensors.

With a smart home security system, you harness your home WiFi network so you can monitor and also control a range of security devices in-app from your smart phone. You can monitor these systems yourself using a mobile app, but many DIY companies also offer flexible, no-contract professional monitoring plans.</p>
<p>With India's labs lacking the capacity to perform testing of this magnitude in a timely manner, there will be further delays in getting these essential products approved and into the hands of consumers," said Joshua Rosenberg, director, global policy, Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), an advocacy and policy organization, in an emailed response.</p>

By pooling city-owned cameras with privately owned cameras, policing experts say an agency in a typical large city may amass hundreds of thousands of video feeds in just a few years. Another type of home security controller, the all-in-one, is actually a security camera that usually contains several wireless radios, motion and sound sensors, and a siren designed to scare off uninvited guests and warn you of an intrusion.</p>
<p>In addition to burglar alarms, popular home security equipment includes surveillance cameras, window and door sensors, glass-break detectors and motion sensors. Madurai City Police have launched a ‘Locked House Monitoring System' (LHMS), under which the city police will install temporary CCTV cameras free of cost in the houses whenever the residents go out of town.</p>
