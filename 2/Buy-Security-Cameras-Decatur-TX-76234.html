This is based on user preference, but many security systems are most commonly controlled by a smartphone app, so often times it is sufficient (and easier for guests) to just have a keypad and then utilize the app for controlling the system on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Smart home-security systems contact you or family members when the alarm goes off through a smartphone or tablet app. As a general rule, all cameras utilized in a security system for after-the-fact investigation and overall deterrence should be recorded and the recording retained in a 10-day library as a minimum.
