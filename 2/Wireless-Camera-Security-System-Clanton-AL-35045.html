<p>In accordance with the invention, a burglar alarm of an automotive vehicle having an electrical system including a battery, battery cables, at least one electrical device for drawing current from the battery, a switch for controlling current flow from the battery to the device and the charging means for supplying charging current to the battery, comprises a direct current coupled input means for providing a voltage directly proportional to the amount of current interchanged between the battery and the electrical system of the automobile; an arming means responsive to the voltage for arming said burglar alarm only when less than a first predetermined current is interchanged between the battery and the electrical system; and an alarm means for producing an alarm when the alarm is armed and more than a second predetermined amount of current is drawn from said battery.</p>
