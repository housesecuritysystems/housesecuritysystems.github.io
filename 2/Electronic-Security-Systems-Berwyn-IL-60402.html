<p>If unauthorized entry to the engine compartment (or trunk) occurs, line 36 goes to a logic high level and sets flip-flop 74. The output of flip-flop 74 is directly connected to a second input of OR gate 90.

Television programs and movies sometimes portray an intruder penetrating a perimeter barrier by breaking through when a CCTV camera had momentarily rotated to another location.</p>
<p>Fort Knox® has worked hard to gain a good reputation with our Houston customers as a company with low rates and quick response times, thanks to our technicians with 20+ years of experience, and our company-owned monitoring center.
