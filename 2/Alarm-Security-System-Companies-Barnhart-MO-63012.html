<p>Human beings who monitor and respond to suspicious activity detected by its security cameras set the Deep Sentinel home surveillance system apart from anything else on the market. Most security cameras simply send you a notification when they detect any type of activity. Wireless burglar alarms work similarly to wired ones, but the sensors communicate with the control panel via a radio frequency.</p>
<p>Alongside sensors and motion detectors, you'll need a hub to enable communication with your security devices using Z-Wave, Zigbee, WiFi or a mesh network like Insteon. Digital video is still relatively new and advances are occurring in leaps and bounds, but as new technology is developed it must be tested, and there's nothing more frustrating than finding out you are an unintended beta site for a new piece of hardware.</p>
<p>Existing home security customers are usually vocal about unfair fees and equipment durability in burglar alarm reviews. Hello Rupe, we are sorry that you cannot record Reolink cameras to your own web server or cloud since our cameras don't support such network protocols.
