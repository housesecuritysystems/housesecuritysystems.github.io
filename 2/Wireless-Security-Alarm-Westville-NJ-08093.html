<p>Private businesses and homes are starting to plug their cameras into police networks, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence are investing closed-circuit television, or CCTV, networks with the power for total public surveillance. Smart home security systems monitor for emergencies and control household items like lights, locks and doors. Their easy DIY installation lets you set up your home security system on your time, but you don't have to do it all on your own because tech support is there to help you every step of the way.</p>
<p>Many people who are looking for DIY home security solutions want systems that they can install and monitor themselves. DIY systems are also modular, so you can easily add sensors and devices as you need them—perhaps a camera by the garage, say, or sensors on the sliding glass door upstairs. CCTV is different from broadcast television as all the equipment is directly connected together with cables or wireless transmitters that can not be received by standard television aerials or transmissions of the video signals are only intended to be accessible by the equipment on its dedicated closed circuit.</p>
<p>Video image processing ( VIP ) identifies vehicles and their associated traffic flow parameters by analysing imagery supplied from CCTV cameras which normally have a fixed field of view. It has to be noted that this is the number of CCTV cameras available with the police and not the total number of CCTV cameras in the state. Multiple streams and angles of high-resolution surveillance comes with a price, requiring up to 20 times more storage capacity that lower-resolution video captured with older technology.</p>
