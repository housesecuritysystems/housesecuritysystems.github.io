<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>The camera also has a night vision feature but just like daytime video recording, footages taken at night look a little underpowered. Pair your sensors with the Ooma Home Security app, and select your notification settings. When the monitoring station receives an alarm signal they can ring though to the premises, which in turn will switch the microphones on and allow them to listen quickly to any activity.</p>

Well think about it, what is an alarm system but a group of circuits that send, receive and act to remote signals.</p>
<p>The output of discharge comparator 40 is connected to a first input of an OR gate 76. The output of OR gate 76 is connected to the set input of flip-flop 72. Thus, once the system is armed, any discharge of current which causes a sufficient drop across battery cable 24 to change the state of discharge comparator 40 produces an output which is supplied to the set input of flip-flop 72.</p>

<p>The second system presents the disadvantage of being expensive to construct and maintain and may also be defeated since an unauthorized intruder can obscure the light source and either repeatedly flash a light on the receiver or direct i0 some other form of flashing light source on the receiver and thereby pass through the protective light beam without causing an alarm to be sent in.</p>
