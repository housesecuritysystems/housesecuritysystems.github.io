<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. IP cameras generally have a larger field of vision than analog cameras.

<p>Software turns your PC into a video surveillance system. If when coming into your premises you accidentally trigger a sensor, this will send a signal down to the monitoring station, which would automatically be treated as an alarm activation. Active motion sensors emit microwaves to detect movement and are better suited to harsh environments, including outdoor use, but are prone to false alerts due to wind-blown debris.</p>

Lighting plays an important role in determining whether a satisfactory video picture will be obtained with monochrome and color cameras and LLL ICCD cameras.</p>
<p>Before we can rethink video security we need to ensure that excellence in video security and data management is given. Weather-ready wired networks let you scatter a combination of dome, turret or bullet cameras around your home-or even multiple properties-to ensure total coverage. Adding an exterior video camera gives you even more control over your home's security.</p>
