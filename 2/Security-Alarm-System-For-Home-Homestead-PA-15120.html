Police response times are 85% faster when an alarm is verified by your security company. CCTV cameras were not ubiquitous, even about 20 years ago.</p>
<p>You can scale capacity behind eight ports of IP connectivity in each E-Series, or scale capacity and multiply IP port connectivity by adding E-Series to your network to handle thousands of camera feeds and playback streams.
