<p>Burglar alarms are common in modern homes today. Best known for its stylish Hive Active Heating smart thermostat, British Gas has since expanded the Hive range to include home motion sensors (from £29), smart plugs (from £39), smart light bulbs (from £19) and two security cameras - the Hive (£129) and Hive View (£189). Lets take a look at some of the best home security devices and systems available in India.</p>
<p>We'll show you how a video surveillance system can help your business reduce loss, document events, improve employee safety, and gain visibility into your operations. They have indoor, outdoor, and doorbell camera options and advanced smart home capabilities. In case of a power loss, the back-up battery will activate to maintain your intruder alarm protection for several hours.</p>

<p>SimpliSafe cameras work as standalone devices. This indicates vast scope for use of more CCTV cameras by organisations in India. Many intruder alarm systems make use of a PIR or passive infra red sensor as a motion detector. Then, beginning in the '90s, equipment costs and monthly monitoring prices began to drop, and they continue to drop even today.

The versatility of these systems makes them desirable; if you're upgrading an old system and don't want to do away with all of your old analog cameras, for example, an HVR can help you make the transition and prepare for a fully IP system in the future.</p>
<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, often use battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have less expensive start-up costs, but may fail if the batteries are not maintained. Omnicast is the IP video management system that enables organizations of all sizes to deploy a surveillance system.
