<p>CCTV cameras over fixed access points are often tied directly to the ACAMS. The CCTV market for network cameras is growing swiftly, as enterprises, small and medium businesses, and end customers are looking to increase perimeter security for critical infrastructures. Smart home security systems focus on convenience and are controlled remotely through the app.</p>
<p>It's usually easy for the monitor to detect differences between a TV and a refrigerator, but devices that use electricity in similar ways (think heating devices, like a toaster and a curling iron) may be more of a challenge. In most cases, surveillance merely enhances people's sense of security rather than their actual physical security. Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of home security systems; at the same time, they are skeptical of investing in it since the prices of security systems are still not affordable for many consumers.</p>
