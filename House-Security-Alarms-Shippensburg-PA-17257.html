<p>Security cameras that are internet-ready are a good way of monitoring your home or your business. DIY monitoring is always available with the free SimpliSafe mobile app. Many security cameras have infrared (IR) light technology, which aids in motion detection and enables the cameras to function in low light. However, in terms of market share, the commercial sector dominates the global CCTV camera market The commercial segment is expected to reach a market size of over US$ 13,100 Mn by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>3 Common security methods include never hiding extra keys outside, never turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours. However, during night time and in poorly lit areas infrared or thermal cameras are used that gives black and white images. Trial monitoring can be built into people's roles so they do not do this full time.</p>

Even though 1080p is generally the standard resolution for cameras we've tested, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensors.</p>
