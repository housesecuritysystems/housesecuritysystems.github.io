<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A still further object of this invention is to provide a photoelectric alarm system which employs a pair of light beams and photo-cells arranged to maintain a normal steady system condition regardless of ambient changes in light and which will always generate a varying output voltage when an unauthorized intruder intercepts either one or both of the light beams to thereby initiate an alarm or actuate an indicator.</p>
<p>As long as you're willing to commit to a contract, the FrontPoint Safe Home Elite system offers a nice selection of security, home automation, and environmental components and is easy to install. The primary feature of these CCTV cameras is that they can work in low light conditions. Unless your home is already prewired for a home monitoring system, a Wi-Fi enabled security camera is much easier to install since you won't have to go into the trouble of setting up cable wires and drilling holes into your wall.</p>

In order to detect such entry, these alarm systems require that each point of entry (hood, trunk door) have associated therewith a switch (including in some cases a light activated by the switch) which would cause current to be drawn from the battery when the point of entry was accessed.</p>
<p>DIY installation with self-monitoring: Some brands we recommend, like Ring, Abode, and Nest, offer both professional and self-monitoring. Others like ADT and Vivint offer professionally installed systems only but typically provide their own installers. Expect to pay an extra Nest Aware fee for every camera you install, including the Nest Hello doorbell. In an open-circuit system, electricity only flows when the trigger is activated - opening the window, for example - and completing the circuit sets off the alarm.</p>
<p>Basically two sensors are used, one is Motion Detector and other one Window Sensor. Magnetic switches are the most common sensing devices for sensing opening and closing of doors and windows.
