<p>Blue by ADT is completely DIY for an easy, free set-up that doesn't require a professional. There are two main ways to record video images that CCTV cameras capture. Burglar alarm systems serve two basic purposes: alerting those both inside and out of a property to the presence of an intruder and deterring potential criminals from entering a property in the first place.</p>
<p>If unauthorized entry to the engine compartment (or trunk) occurs, line 36 goes to a logic high level and sets flip-flop 74. The output of flip-flop 74 is directly connected to a second input of OR gate 90. This instantly activates sounding timer 92 and the alarm is sounded for two minutes until reset due to the action of one shot 94, as described above.</p>
<p>Advantages: less expensive than many other methods, less likely to give false alarms than many other alternative perimeter security methods, and highest psychological deterrent of all methods. With these devices, you pop a magnet onto your door or window with the sensor and tiny alarm unit nearby. Our 24 hour-a-day 7-day-a-week monitoring service ensures that you are protected 365 days out of the year.</p>

Optional equipment, including video doorbells, indoor and outdoor cameras, glass-break sensors and home automation features, are available for an additional cost. Here's a tip: You might not even need to buy a real CCTV camera, baby monitor, IP cam or IP webcam.</p>
