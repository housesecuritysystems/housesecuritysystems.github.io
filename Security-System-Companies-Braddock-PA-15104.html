<p>The circuit includes an alarm bell and battery, and the latter begins to ring and continues until stopped, either by the closing of the door or by a switch being turned. Whether you need basic wired analog cameras, or you want the latest wireless IP cameras with every advanced feature available, we can address your needs. When selecting CCTV cameras it's important to consider lens size, wide angle degree and memory for data storage.</p>
