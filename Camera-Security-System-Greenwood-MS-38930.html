<p>Norman Whitfield , former Motown producer and songwriter, was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion for failing to report more than $4 million worth of royalties to the Internal Revenue Service , fined $25,000 and sentenced to six months under house arrest in lieu of jail time because of health issues, including diabetes. Video monitoring networks inevitably entangle and implicate a whole ecosystem of vendors, some of whom have offered, or may yet offer, services specifically targeted at such systems.</p>
<p>The idea behind this initiative, said to be the brainchild of City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, is that installing CCTV cameras across the city would act as a deterrent against crime, as these cameras are a means for the police to keep watch. On the live view, the user can select a person or object and - when having motorized cameras - the cctv camera will move accordingly and follow it, keeping the element of importance constantly in clear view.</p>
<p>Nest thoughtfully designs its equipment and packages too; it includes two key fobs with every security equipment package—that's normally an add-on.

This is vital if you have a camera that overlooks a busy road, for example.</p>

But these very cameras can be exploited as tools for illegal surveillance and even hacking.
