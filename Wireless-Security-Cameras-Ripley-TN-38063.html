If you need help with your system, ADT offers an online knowledge base or you can call anytime for help. If you want more peace of mind that a problem at your home will be dealt with quickly, you could consider a burglar alarm with a monitoring contract - 38% of the people we spoke pay for one of these.</p>

<p>However, Growing government and stakeholder funding for developing smart cities and employing city surveillance solutions, rising demand for VSaaS services, ongoing technological advancements in Big Data, IoT, and cloud-based services, and rising trends of artificial intelligence and deep learning for video surveillance systems will provide opportunities to players in the video surveillance market during the forecast period.</p>
<p>There are helpful videos online to assist with self-installation but there is no professional installation option for this home security system.

<p>Controls the flow of access and monitor time-attendance of employees from anywhere at any time through web server. Some providers like ADT, Vivint, and abode allow you to finance your equipment over a period of time. These products can be widely used for electronic policing, security surveillance, toll stations, entrance & exit controls, and road monitoring systems.</p>
<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set amount of time, typically one to five years. To help you with this important decision, we'll run through all the key features of a home security system, discuss some important choices homeowners must make, and review the major companies offering systems, while first providing some of the main reasons your home may be at risk.</p>
<p>Crowd Detection is a Senstar Symphony or edge-based video analytic that estimates the number of people within a given area in real time and triggers an alarm when a specified number of people (capacity) or a specified percentage of people (occupancy) is reached.

<p>With the private and public sector looking to expand the presence of cameras, video surveillance has become a new cash cow. Manufacturers promote the use of spy cameras for various applications with the advent of AI, BIG data analytics, cloud computing, and face recognition options. However, factors such as high investment cost and lack of professional expertise in handling IP cameras, hamper the market growth.</p>
<p>DVRs evolved from the older VCR models, while NVRs represent the next step in the evolution of video recording technology. With homes that use additional home security measures 5 times less likely to be burgled, a visible home alarm is a sound investment. The intrusion monitoring service is included in all our packages. Bottom Line: The Ring Indoor Cam is an affordable smart security camera that delivers sharp 1080p video.</p>
