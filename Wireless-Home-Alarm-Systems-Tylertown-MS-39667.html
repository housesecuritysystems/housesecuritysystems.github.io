Some providers like ADT, Vivint, and abode allow you to finance your equipment over a period of time.

<p>The ability to interpret video data directly at the source helps to substantially improve levels of security, as well as offering clear business advantages. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and provides power to it.
