Their equipment is filled with next-level features including custom motion zones and facial recognition making them the best provider for DIY smart home security. Few cameras were placed in public, and the power to track people was limited: If police wanted to pursue a person of interest, they had to spend hours collecting footage by foot from nearby locations.</p>
<p>Video doorbells are the most popular security product owned (18.2%) with a professionally monitored home security system (16.2%) as 2nd most popular. Customer service is often overlooked in an industry like this where people don't think they're ever going to talk to their alarm company. Television programs and movies sometimes portray an intruder penetrating a perimeter barrier by breaking through when a CCTV camera had momentarily rotated to another location.</p>
<p>The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable. The main features of these security cameras are its high resolution and scalability.
