<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, skepticism has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in false alarms. Homeowners can choose from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can record footage when an alarm is triggered, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, nanny cameras, and more. Monitoring fees begin at $29, and equipment costs range from $299 to $499.
