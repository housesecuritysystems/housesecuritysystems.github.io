Microphonic systems vary in design (for example, time-domain reflectrometry or piezo-electric ) but each is generally based on the detection of an intruder attempting to cut or climb over a fence. If you have 15 doors and a million windows, then you'll need more sensors and equipment than someone who lives in a studio apartment.</p>
<p>They'll record video when the doorbell is pressed or when motion is detected, and usually offer two-way audio communication that allows you to speak with the visitor from anywhere via your phone. Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. Maybe, you could succeed, but it would be better to install CCTV security systems in your house to protect your valuable assets.</p>
