Addressing concerns about the over-reliance on cameras, Mr. Viswanathan says he does not see CCTVs as a solution to every problem.</p>
<p>Most cameras also feature infrared night vision capable of surveillance in total darkness. The Monitoring Association (TMA) ensures quality and customer service excellence. It comes with a fast Wi-Fi set up functionality that enables you to install and monitor the camera through a specific mobile app on your smartphone or tablet.

Some home security companies sell alarms and equipment individually, and others offer packages of bundled devices.</p>
