<p>So you've got a ClickHouse DB, and you're looking for a tool to monitor it. You've come to the right place. Smart technology provides that control, it means you can manage everything from making sure you didn't forget to set the alarm to checking if the kids got home from school okay - all from your mobile device whilst you're out and about.
