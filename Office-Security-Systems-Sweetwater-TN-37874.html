Smart home equipment is getting better and more affordable every year, so if you're building a home security system, it's not a bad idea to start integrating smart devices now.

<p>But ADT is known to offer deals that alleviate the cost of equipment, which makes the overall cost for a 36-month contract a lot more reasonable.
