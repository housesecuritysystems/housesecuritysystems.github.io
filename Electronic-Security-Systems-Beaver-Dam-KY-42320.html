<p>Current glass-break detectors trigger an alarm when the window pane breaks but lack in detecting ways burglars temper with glass. However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the same); they generally capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is normally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Equipment's not the only thing that Ring Alarm sells on the cheap; it's also professional monitoring. Security cameras can be very helpful in alerting you to an event or showing you what happened after the fact. There is a single (or sometimes two) sensors inside looking for changes in infrared energy. At larger airports, this means the purchase, installation, and integration of hundreds or thousands of CCTV cameras.</p>

Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
