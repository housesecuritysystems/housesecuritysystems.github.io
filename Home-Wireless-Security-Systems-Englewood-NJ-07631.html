<p>Boost safety and security with Medianet-enabled Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. ADT security systems require professional installation. Digital cameras are becoming the industry standard for their resolution and the ability to store tons of data on hard drives, rather than videotapes. As you compare home security systems, it helps to understand the difference between wired or wireless systems and monitored or unmonitored alarms. Find a provider that offers an appropriate trial period to allow time for you to test out of your equipment.</p>
<p>As long as you're willing to commit to a contract, the FrontPoint Safe Home Elite system offers a nice selection of security, home automation, and environmental components and is easy to install.

Some security systems offer additional features, such as immediate alarms, which don't depend upon a confirmation call or silent alarms that don't alert intruders and give them a chance to disable the system before the follow-up signal is sent.</p>
